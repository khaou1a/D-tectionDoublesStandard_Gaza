            "content": "Iran-backed militia groups have carried out at least 160 attacks on US targets in Iraq and Syria since October 17.\nThe Israeli military expects the war against Hamas to continue through the end of 2024 and possibly even into 2025, an Israeli intelligence official told reporters on Tuesday.\nIsraeli Defense Forces(IDF) are currently engaged in the heaviest fighting around the city of Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza. The Israeli intelligence officer briefing reporters on Tuesday said the IDF has killed \"at least a quarter\" of Hamas' estimated fighting force of 35,000, and at least another quarter are wounded, according to Bloomberg.\nHamas' vast network of tunnels have allowed many of its troops and leaders to operate despite Israeli control of much of the territory.\nThe Israeli official said Israel remains far away from achieving its stated goals of capturing Hamas' leaders and ammunition reserves and rendering Hamas military bases and tunnels inoperative, Bloomberg reported.\nAUSTRIA SUSPENDS PAYMENTS TO UNRWA AMID ISRAELI ALLEGATIONS UN WORKERS HELPED, CELEBRATED HAMAS\nThe Israeli military expects the war against Hamas to continue through the end of 2024 and possibly even into 2025, according to Israeli officials.(Reuters/Ronen Zvulun)\nThe city's network of tunnels is even more expansive than that of Gaza City to the north. Israeli operations have also gathered extensive intelligence on how Hamas operates, particularly in how it coordinates rocket attacks against Israel.\nFor weeks, Hamas has remained capable of launching barrages into Israel even from areas largely under Israeli control. The intelligence officer stated that Hamas terrorists, once given the order, will bring a timed detonator to a pre-prepared launch site, prime the rockets, and then leave. Some time later, the battery of rockets will fire, according to Bloomberg.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated at the beginning of January that the war will last \"many more months,\" and vowed that Israel would not relent until Hamas is destroyed.\nHamas leader Yahya Sinwar remains at large, though he is believed to be somewhere within Khan Younis.\nThe IDF also detailed anoperation on Mondayin which it blew up a Hamas tunnel underneath a cemetery.\nISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTRY CALLS FOR UNRWA COMMISSIONER TO RESIGN AMID ALLEGATIONS ITS WORKERS ASSISTED HAMAS\nIsraeli soldiers raided the tunnel system in the Bani Suheila neighborhood in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, finding explosives, sliding doors and blast-proof doors, the IDF said. Terrorists were still inside, according to theIsraeli military,and were killed.\nHamas leader Yahya Sinwar remains at large, though he is believed to be somewhere within Khan Younis.(MAHMUD HAMS/AFP via Getty Images)\nThe tunnels housed the office of a Hamas commander, an operations room, and living quarters for senior members of Hamas, according to the IDF. It said the tunnel was used to plan attacks against the military, as well as the deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\nISRAEL TO BAN REBUILDING OF ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS IN GAZA FOLLOWING CONCERNS FROM BIDEN ADMIN\nAn Israeli soldier is seen in the Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis on Saturday, Jan. 27.(AP/Sam McNeil)\nAs Israel moves forward with a ground and aircampaign in Gaza,Hamas officials in the besieged enclave say over 26,000 Palestinians have been killed.\nFox News' Stephen Sorace contributed to this report\nAnders Hagstrom is a reporter with Fox News Digital covering national politics and major breaking news events.

Daniel Hagari stands in front of the house of a senior terrorist who led the raids into Israel, which is next to a school and about 200 yards from a hospital.\nHagari then shows an operational tunnel with electrical wires going down about 20 meters into the tunnel, which leads to a bulletproof and explosive-proof door.\nGAZA HOSPITAL COVERAGE PROVES MEDIA NEEDS TO BE SKEPTICAL OF SOURCES, EXPERT SAYS: ‘ALL THE FACTS WERE WRONG’\nMotorcycle with bullet hole found in tunnel leading to basement of Rantisi Hospital in Gaza.(IDF)\nThe IDF spokesman intended to show \"clear evidence\" that the tunnels were connected to the Rantisi hospital that Hamas used as a base.\nHe then leads the camera crew into the tunnel and to the hospital, where evidence is found that a Hamasoperation was conducted.\n\"We are now in the area of the basement of the hospital.

Col. Peter Lerner, blasted mainstream media outlets for running with Hamas’ claim that Israel was responsible for an explosion that rocked the al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City.\nIsrael had been accused of shooting missiles at the hospital, though it was ultimately determined that Hamas fired missiles from Gaza, and one went rogue before striking near the hospital, discrediting claims there was a direct hit on the facility.\nHamas has also been accused of using civilians as shields, as they hide among the population and wear civilian clothing during their attacks.\n\"This is an organization that will butcher babies in their bedrooms, they’ll have no problem lying to you,\" Lerner said at the time.\nBrian Flood of Fox News Digital contributed to this report.\nGreg Wehner is a breaking news reporter for Fox News Digital.\nStory tips and ideas can be sent to Greg.Wehner@Fox.com and on Twitter @GregWehner.",

            "content": "Israeli soldiers operating against Hamas and other terrorists in close-quarters fighting in Gaza. (Video: IDF Spokesman's Unit.)\nJERUSALEM — One of the top urban warfare experts in the U.S. believes the Israeli military is taking unprecedented measures — above and beyond what most armies do — to avoid harming Palestinian civilians as it battles theIslamist terror group Hamasin Gaza.\nHe adds that comparisons cannot be drawn between the intensity of the four-month-old war and other recent conflicts.\nAs Israel gears up for what could be the fiercest and most complicated battle in the Strip’s southernmost city, Rafah, John Spencer, chair of the Urban Warfare Studies Modern War Institute at West Point and an author of multiple books on the subject of urban warfare, told Fox News Digital the \"steps that Israel has taken to prevent casualties is historic in comparison to all these other wars.\"\n\"Israel has taken more steps to avoid harming civilians than any other military in history,\" said Spencer, who served for more than 25 years in the U.S. military, reaching the rank of major. He says that such lengths would set a new standard that other Western militaries would struggle to follow in the future.\nUN, HUMAN RIGHTS, MEDIA GROUPS RELY ON HAMAS DEATH TOLL IN 'SYSTEMATIC DECEPTION': EXPERT\nIDF officers go over maps in Khan Younis, Gaza.(IDF Spokesman's Unit)\nIsrael launched its war in the Gaza Strip following Hamas’ Oct. 7 terror attack that killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw some 240 people taken hostage, including babies, children, women and the elderly. Since starting its ground invasion of the Palestinian enclave, however, Israel’s military has faced sharp criticism as even its close allies, including the U.S., cite a death toll based on Hamas data.\nAccording to figures published daily by the Hamas-run Health Ministry, the number of deaths has surpassed 28,000, without distinguishing between civilians and combatants. On Tuesday, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said that at least a third of those killed, some 10,000, were Hamas terrorists, including many of the Iranian-backed group’s commanders.\n\"What has really blown my mind is that Israel issued maps to the civilians [in Gaza] telling them where they would be operating each day. … I've never seen a military do that\"\n\"Despite the numbers, Israel is setting the bar very high on civilian harm mitigation steps,\" said Spencer, who is also host of the \"Urban Warfare Project\" podcast and serves as the chair of Urban Warfare Studies at the New York-basedMadison Policy Forum.\nHe outlined how the Israeli military took measures that no other military, including the U.S., has previously takenduring war, such as calling and texting individuals to warn them of a forthcoming air strike and sharing maps with plans for military maneuvers in certain areas.\n\"We’ve never called everybody in a war environment. We’ve never actually sat down thousands of soldiers in call centers and had them call into the combat area trying to reach imams and mayors in an effort to get everybody get out of harm's way,\" noted Spencer.\nBIDEN ADMIN CONTINUES PUSH FOR TWO-STATE SOLUTION AS CRITICS WARN: 'EFFORTS REPEATEDLY FAIL'\nAn aerial view of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees tent camp, where hundreds of Gazan families fleeing Israeli attacks are trying to survive with limited means and difficult conditions in Khan Younis, Gaza, Nov. 27, 2023.(Ashraf Amra/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\"The element of surprise is usually a top priority in wars, but Israel is giving up all of that in order to prevent civilian harm\"\n\"As someone who teaches division level urban warfare, what has really blown my mind is that Israel issued maps to the civilians [in Gaza] telling them where they would be operating each day. … I've never seen a military do that,\" said Spencer, who visited Israel last month and toured the combat zone in and around Gaza.\n\"Doing this puts the attacking military at a disadvantage because it signals to the defending military what they’re doing,\" he said. \"The element of surprise is usually a top priority in wars, but Israel is giving up all of that in order to prevent civilian harm.\n\"If that is going to be the standard going forward, I don't know how the U.S. military and others are going to do that. We’re not going to send text messages. We’re not going to be able to put out maps, even if we do decide to give warnings.\"\nSpencer, who has examined U.S. military actions inIraq and Afghanistanand multiple other modern-day conflicts, said those criticizing Israel, including the media and countries such as South Africa, are ignorant of previous conflicts and a failure to fully understand the laws of warfare.\nSouth Africa recently brought a case to the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza.\nISRAEL REJECTS UN, AID AGENCIES CRITICISM THAT GAZA IS ON BRINK OF STARVATION: 'NO SHORTAGE OF FOOD'\n\"There are a couple of camps of people observing the Gaza War,\" he said. \"One group sees anything Israel does as wrong because they believe that Israel is the oppressor and the Palestinian people are the oppressed. So, no matter the context of the Oct. 7 attack or the hostages, anything Israel does is with ill intention.\nA picture taken from the border between Israel and Gaza shows leaflets being dropped by the Israeli army over Gaza City telling people to evacuate the area on November 16, 2023. Photo by JACK GUEZ/AFP via Getty Images(Photo by JACK GUEZ/AFP via Getty Images)\n\"The other camp,particularly in the United States, is made up of people that are really bad at history, even our own history,\" said Spencer, pointing out that few people study the details of modern-day urban combat.\n\"It is hard to find people who actually know what the army did in our own conflicts in places like Fallujah and Mosul [in Iraq],\" he said, pointing out that using Google or Wikipedia references to find out more about conflicts that might be considered similar to Gaza fails to provide adequate information.\nThis photograph taken on January 20, 2024 in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip shows a man holding one of the leaflets, which were dropped by Israeli forces over the city, showing portraits of Israeli hostages held in Gaza since the October 7 attacks by Hamas in southern Israel. The leaflet reads (bottom-right) \"Do you want to go home? Please report any information if you recognise any of them.\"(AFP via Getty Images)\n\"When the war in Gaza started, for example, people Googled it and found articles saying Gaza is the densest place on earth and that just became a worldwide slogan,\" Spencer noted. \"People do need comparisons if they’re really honestly trying to understand versus just grasping at anything that makes Israel look bad. But no [other military] has ever faced anything like this.\"\nUsing the example ofHamas’ vast network of terrortunnels that snake below many urban areas in Gaza, Spencer emphasized that the realities of warfare in the Palestinian enclave were unlike anywhere else.\n\"Tunnels aren’t new, but building them underneath civilian structures for the sole purpose of using the laws of war against the military is,\" he said. He added that general ignorance about urban warfare and the unique setting of Israel’s particular war in Gaza, combined with a lack of knowledge about the laws of war, meant Israel was being held to unfair standards.\nEXCLUSIVE: ISRAEL CREATES AI PLATFORM TO MONITOR THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN GAZA\nSmoke rises over buildings as Israeli airstrikes continue in the Al-Rimal neighborhood of Gaza City, Gaza, Oct. 9, 2023(Ali Jadallah/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\"There's a lot of myths out there, including among those who took Israel to the ICJ,\" Spencer said. \"The case against Israel included a lot of myths, not just about what happened but what is lawful, what is historical precedent and what’s happened in the past.\"\nDiscussing the Geneva Conventions, a series ofinternational humanitarian lawswritten following World War II to enshrine legal standards for humanitarian treatment in war, Spencer said they were designed to never repeat what happened in Europe, \"but it’s like we want to erase our memory as well.\"\n\"I think the Geneva Conventions were amazing and good to enforce, but the problem is people don’t understand that what they're seeing is actually what it looks like to follow the rules,\" he said. \"We build a system where people who don't want to follow rules, like Hamas, want to use those rules against the people following them.\n\"I want the world to do more to stop people who don't follow the laws,\" said Spencer. \"Israel is not only being held to a ridiculous standard that nobody else has ever been held to. But it is also really testing thepost-World War IIway of warfare against a context that nobody else has faced.\"\nRuth Marks Eglash is a veteran journalist based inJerusalem, Israel.

            "content": "Former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Oren says the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is an incredible moment for Israel, the U.S. and the free world.\nHamas terror chief Yahya Sinwarhas been killed during an Israeli military operation in the Gaza Strip, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced Thursday.\nThe IDF and Israel's Shin Bet intelligence agency released a joint statement saying it can \"confirm that after a year-long pursuit, yesterday (Wednesday), October 16, 2024, IDF soldiers from the Southern Command eliminated Yahya Sinwar, the leader of the Hamas terrorist organization, in an operation in the southern Gaza Strip.\"\n\"Yahya Sinwar planned and executed the October 7th Massacre, promoted his murderous ideology both before and during the war, and was responsible for the murder and abduction of many Israelis,\" the statement added. \"Yahya Sinwar was eliminated after hiding for the past year behind the civilian population of Gaza, both above and below ground in Hamas tunnels in the Gaza Strip.\"\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday following the confirmation of Sinwar's death that Hamas suffered a \"heavy blow\" but the war in Gaza is not yet over. Netanyahu added that \"Hamas will no longer rule Gaza\" and \"this is the beginning of the day after Hamas, and this is an opportunity for you, the residents of Gaza, to finally break free from its tyranny.\"\nNetanyahu also said Sinwar \"ran away in fear from our soldiers\" prior to being killed.\n\"He told you he was a lion, but in reality, he was hiding in a dark den — and he was killed when he fled in a panic from our soldiers,\" Netanyahu said in a televised message.\nYahya Sinwar chairs a meeting with leaders of Palestinian factions at his office in Gaza City on April 13, 2022.(AP)\n\"The darkness has been retreating and the light has been rising,\" he said.\nReferred to by Israel as the Butcher of Khan Younis for his violent and cruel torture methods against his enemies, both Israeli and Palestinian, Sinwar, 61, is widely seen as being behind the massacre of Israeli civilians carried out by thousands of Hamas militants on Oct. 7.\nThe IDF and Shin Bet said earlier Thursday, \"During IDF operations in the Gaza Strip, three terrorists were eliminated\" and that it was \"checking the possibility that one of the terrorists was Yahya Sinwar.\"\nAn Israel Army Radio report said Thursday that Sinwar was killed during a battle with Israeli soldiers.\nThe soldiers had spotted suspected terrorists in Gaza and opened fire before the individuals fled into a building, according to the report. It added that a tank then fired a shell at the building, causing it to collapse.\nWhen the soldiers went inside to examine the aftermath, they found three bodies — one of which ultimately has been identified as Sinwar.\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, left, Shin Bet leader Ronen Bar, center, and General Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi of the Israel Defense Forces, right, are seen speaking Thursday near the Gaza border. Israel confirmed Thursday it has killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.(IDF)\nHAMAS NAMES YAHYA SINWAR, MASTERMIND OF OCT. 7 ATTACKS, AS ITS NEW LEADER\n\"The master murderer, Yahya Sinwar, who is responsible for the massacre and atrocities of October 7, was killed today by IDF soldiers,\" Foreign Minister Israel Katz also told Fox News in a statement.\nA U.S. defense official has told Fox News that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was passed a note during a NATO Defense Ministerial meeting on Sinwar’s death. The Israelis, the official says, notified U.S. Department of Defense officials and have passed along photos.\nUpon hearing the news of Sinwar's death, President Biden said: \"This is a good day for Israel, for the United States, and for the world.\"\n\"Israel has had every right to eliminate the leadership and military structure of Hamas. Hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another Oct. 7,\" he said.\nBiden said he would be speaking with Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders to congratulate them.\nPentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder stressed on Thursday that U.S. forces were not directly involved in the operation.\n\"Just to be crystal clear, this was an Israeli operation,\" he told reporters. \"There [were] no U.S. forces directly involved. The United States has helped contribute information and intelligence as it relates to hostage recovery, and the tracking and locating of Hamas leaders, who have been responsible for holding hostages, and so certainly that contributes, in general, to the picture.\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum said Thursday in a statement that it \"commends the security forces for eliminating Sinwar, who masterminded the greatest massacre our country has ever faced, responsible for the murder of thousands and the abduction of hundreds.\"\n\"However, we express deep concern for the fate of the 101 men, women, elderly and children still held captive by Hamas in Gaza. We call on the Israeli government, world leaders, and mediating countries to leverage the military achievement into a diplomatic one by pursuing an immediate agreement for the release of all 101 hostages: the living for rehabilitation and the murdered for proper burial,\" it added.\nA demonstrator holds a sign about the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar during a protest calling for a cease-fire deal and the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas on Thursday in Tel Aviv, Israel.(AP/Ariel Schalit)\nISRAEL’S HUNT FOR HAMAS TERROR LEADER YAHYA SINWAR: ‘DEAD MAN WALKING’\nIn Washington, D.C., House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said, \"Justice has once again been served by the brave men and women of the Israeli military.\"\n\"At this moment, with the bloodthirsty leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah now gone, the Biden-Harris Administration must now work in tandem with Israel to apply a maximum pressure campaign against the head of the snake: Iran,\" he added.\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said, \"The Israeli people — through their political leadership, the IDF and their intelligence services — have delivered a mighty blow to Hamas and Iran, and rendered some sense of justice with the elimination of Sinwar.\"\nIsraeli Defense Forces spokesman Lt.

            "content": "Fox News national correspondent Jeff Paul discusses Israel’s planned takeover of Gaza City amid its conflict with Hamas on ‘Fox News Live.’\nFIRST ON FOX:A new study disputes claims thatIsrael committed genocidein Gaza following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, arguing that allegations of starvation, indiscriminate bombing and deliberate civilian killings lack verifiable evidence.\nThe reportby researchers from the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University, \"Debunking the Genocide Allegations: A Reexamination of the Israel-Hamas War\" (2023-2025), contends that the genocide narrative has been driven by faulty data, uncritical sourcing and a humanitarian system vulnerable to manipulation.\nA key element of the genocide accusations is the claim that Israel deliberately starved Gaza’s population. The study argues that \"claims of starvation prior to March 2, 2025, were based on erroneous data, circular citations, and a failure to critically review sources.\" While U.N. officials and rights groups maintained that 500 trucks a day were needed to prevent famine, prewar U.N. figures show Gaza averaged 292 daily in 2022 — only 73 of them carrying food.\nUN EXPERT REPEATS ISRAEL 'GENOCIDE' CLAIMS AFTER US CALLS FOR HER REMOVAL\nThe Chief of the General Staff LTG Eyal Zamir, conducted a field tour in the Gaza Strip.(IDF Spokesman's Unit)\n\"That was completely adequate to meet demand,\" report co-author Danny Orbach, a military historian from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told Fox News Digital.\nThe study says Israel regularly surpassed the food supply needed during the war, averaging more than 100 trucks a day through March 2025. During a ceasefire-for-hostage deal, that number climbed to about 600 daily.\n\"The idea thatHamas didn’t seize aidis absurd,\" Orbach said. \"In every conflict, armed groups take the bulk of humanitarian supplies. We have documents and testimonies proving Hamas did so.\"\nThe report argues that genocide allegations spread through what Orbach called an \"inverted funnel of information.\" Journalists and aid workers in Gaza often depended on Hamas-linked translators and fixers, whose accounts filtered into U.N. reports, mainstream media and online platforms.\n\"The average Westerner sees dozens of reports about Israeli crimes and assumes they must be true. But they all trace back to a handful of Hamas-affiliated sources,\" Orbach said.\nIsraeli air strikes on Gaza a day after Hamas terrorists invaded parts of southern Israel. Oct 2023.(Mustafa Hassona/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\nThe second factor is \"humanitarian bias\" — the tendency to exaggerate conditions to prompt action. \"Organizations warn of famine before it happens, relying on dubious facts to change reality. Questioning becomes an immoral act,\" Orbach said.\nThe genocide allegation also rests on claims that Israel intentionally targeted civilians, but the study acknowledges civilian deaths while finding no evidence of a systematic policy of massacre.\nOrbach cited BBC data showing that between May 2024 and January 2025, 550 people were killed in designated safe zones—just 2.1% to 3.5% of total casualties, even though half of Gaza’s population was concentrated there for much of the period.\nHamas terrorists take up positions ahead of a hostage release in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip on Feb. 8, 2025.(AP)\nISRAEL TURNS TABLES ON UN OFFICIAL CLAIMING 'GENOCIDE' IN GAZA WITH BASIC QUESTIONS\n\"That indicates the zones were relatively safe, despite Hamas using them to launch rockets,\" Orbach stated.\nThe report notes that context is crucial, stating that Hamas deliberately positioned itself in civilian areas, used human shields andblocked evacuationsto increase civilian casualties and international condemnation of Israel.\n\"Hamas exposes its own people to danger intentionally so Israel will be blamed,\" Orbach said.\nA Gazan man mourns relatives killed in Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip, at a hospital morgue in Deir al-Balah, Tuesday, July 9, 2024.(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)\nWhile critics have accused the Israeli air force of indiscriminate bombing, the study finds that strikes generally targeted military objectives, though civilian casualties were inevitable.\n\"The IDF is the first army in history to issuefocused warnings, deliver large-scale aid into enemy territory, and sacrifice surprise to protect civilians,\" he said. \"You cannot fight an enemy embedded in 500 kilometers of tunnels, dressed as civilians without massive destruction.\"\nThe study pays particular attention to casualty figures published by the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, claiming they were manipulated to create misleading impressions of the demographics of the dead. It presents alternative statistical models suggesting combatant fatalities may have been underreported, distorting the civilian-to-combatant ratio.\nHamas terrorists carrying clubs and firearms secure and divert humanitarian aid trucks in the northern Gaza area of Jabaliya on June. 25(TPS-IL)\nThe report says that genocide requires systematic intent to destroy a people — something it finds absent in Gaza. \"You don’t see the hallmarks of genocidal warfare here,\" Orbach said. \"There are no campaigns of rape, frontal massacres or close-range executions. In other conflicts in theMiddle East, dozens of such atrocities occurred in just a few hours of fighting.\"\nThe IDF announced its troops are now operating in Rafah. Its troops are continuing ground activity in northern and central Gaza.(IDF)\nOrbach and his fellow authors conclude that allegations of genocide against Israel rely on politicized narratives, selective data and the exploitation of humanitarian discourse.\n\"Analyzing devastation or civilian deaths without understanding Hamas’ tactics is absurd,\" he stated.\nAmelie Botbol is a freelance journalist based in Tel Aviv.

            "content": "Fox News correspondent Trey Yingst has the latest on the Israel-Hamas war on 'Hannity.'\nIsraeli strikeson the Gaza Strip eliminated the head of the Hamas government and other key terrorist leaders in a wave of violence following the collapse of their ceasefire agreement, Israeli forces announced Tuesday.The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israel Security Agency (ISA), also known as Shin Bet, said in a joint statement that the airstrikes eliminated Essam al-Da'alis, head of the Hamas government and \"the most senior figure of authority in the Gaza Strip.\"\n\"Essam al-Da'alis replaced Rawhi Mushtaha in this position after he was eliminated in July 2024. In his role, al-Da'alis was responsible for the functioning of Hamas' terror regime in the Gaza Strip and oversaw the integration of all of Hamas’ branches in Gaza and their use for terrorist purposes,\" the statement said.The IDF and ISA also determined with \"high probability\" that Israeli strikes eliminated Mahmoud Marzouk Ahmed Abu-Watfa, the Minister of Internal Affairs in charge of Hamas' Internal Security Forces; Bahajat Hassan Mohammed Abu-Sultan, who served as Head of Hamas' Internal Security Forces; and Ahmed Amar Abdullah Alhata, who served as Hamas' Minister of Justice.\nREMAINS OF SHIRI BIBAS, MOM OF TWO KILLED, ALLEGEDLY RETURNED TO ISRAEL FOLLOWING HAMAS' BROKEN PROMISE\nA view of demolished buildings and damage in the city of Rafah, Gaza, after Israeli airstrikes.(Abed Zagout/Anadolu via Getty Images)\nOver the past day, the IDF said it \"struck dozens of terror targets and terrorists throughout the Gaza Strip, including mid-level and senior-ranking terrorists in Hamas' Political Bureau.\"\n\"The strikes were conducted to damage Hamas' governmental and military capabilities, and to remove threats to the State of Israel and its citizens,\" the statement said. \"The IDF will continue to operate against the Hamas terrorist organization and remove any threat to the State of Israel.\"At least 404 Palestinians, including women and children, have been killed in the airstrikes so far, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. The death toll has not been independently verified.\nPresident Donald Trump's administration backed Israel's move to end the ceasefire in a statement on Monday.\n\"Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war,\" National Security Council (NSC) spokesman Brian Hughes told Fox News.\nIsrael will intensify its military actionsagainst Hamasmoving forward, authorities said.\n\"Under the direction of the political echelon, the IDF and Shin Bet are widely attacking terrorist targets of the Hamas terrorist organization throughout the Gaza Strip, more details below,\" the IDF and ISA said.\nNetanyahu with Defense minister Israel Katz, IDF chief Eyal Zamir. And other security officials  are holding a security assessment in the Kirya in Tel Aviv.(Prime Minister of Israel )\nThe IDF launched a series of preemptive strikes targeting mid-ranking military commanders, leadership officials and terrorist infrastructure belonging to the Hamas terrorist organization, an Israeli official told Fox News. The military offensive will continue as long as necessary, and will expand beyond air strikes, the official said.\nDozens of targets were chosen, based on Hamas readiness to execute terror attacks, and build up and re-arm its forces. Following a situational assessment by Katz and the IDF officials, a decision was made not to open up schools and educational activities in the Gaza Envelope, authorities said.\nThe office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the airstrikes came after Hamas \"rejected all offers it received\" from the Trump administration's special envoy to the Mideast, Steve Witkoff, and the other mediators.\nHAMAS FREES THREE MORE HOSTAGES IN EXCHANGE FOR MORE THAN 300 PRISONERS AS PART OF CEASEFIRE DEAL WITH ISRAEL\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends a security assessment after the ceasefire with Hamas disintegrated this week.(Prime Minister of Israel )\n\"Tonight, we returned to fighting in Gaza due to Hamas' refusal to release the hostages and threats to harm IDF soldiers and Israeli communities,\" Katz said. \"If Hamas does not release all the hostages, the gates of hell will open in Gaza, and Hamas' murderers and rapists will meet the IDF with forces they have never known before.\"\nHe noted that Israel \"will not stop fighting until all the hostages return home and all the war's goals are achieved.\"\nThe Israeli military ordered people to evacuate eastern Gaza and move toward the center of the territory after its airstrikes across the territory, suggesting that the military could launch renewed ground operations into Gaza.\nIn a statement, Hamas blamed Netanyahu \"and the Nazi Zionist occupation fully responsible for the repercussions of the treacherous aggression on Gaza, and for the defenseless civilians and our besieged Palestinian people, who are subjected to a brutal war and a systematic policy of starvation.\"\nThe terror group called for theUnited Nationsand the U.N. Security Council to urgently convene to adopt a resolution demanding Israel halt military operations and fully withdraw from Gaza and for Muslim nations to back Palestinian resistance.\nHamas has insisted on sticking with the original terms of the deal, with Israel fully withdrawing from Gaza and agreeing to permanently end the war in exchange for the release of the remaining living hostages.\nNetanyahu has long insisted that Israel will not end the war until Hamas’ governing and military capabilities have been destroyed.\nThe strikes come after nearly two months of a ceasefire to pause the17-month-long warwhere dozens of hostages were released in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.\nOn Monday, Israeli forces launched airstrikes in Gaza,southern Lebanonand southern Syria. The IDF said it was targeting terrorists plotting attacks.\nFox News' Nick Rojas and the Associated Press contributed to this report.\nLouis Casiano is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

            "content": "Israel Defense Forces uncover an elaborate tunnel in the Hamas stronghold of Khan Younis. (Credit: IDF via APTN)\nTheIsraeli Defense Forces(IDF) released a video showing what it describes as one of Hamas’s \"most complex\" underground infrastructures extending beneath the southern Gaza city of Rafah.\nAccording to the IDF, the seven-kilometer-long \"root tunnel\" runs roughly 25 meters underground, contains about 80 rooms and was used for command operations, weapons storage and sheltering Hamas operatives.\nThe video shared on X on Nov. 20 travels through reinforced concrete passageways and large chambers, showing the sophistication and scale ofHamas’s underground network.\nThe Israeli military claims the tunnel originated beneath a United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) compound and stretched beneath civilian sites.\nISRAEL'S DOHA STRIKE SENT A DECISIVE MESSAGE THAT TERROR WILL FIND NO SAFE HAVEN\n\"IDF troops uncovered one of Gaza’s largest and most complex underground routes, over 7 km long, ~25 meters deep, with ~80 hideouts, where abducted IDF officer Lt. Hadar Goldin was held,\" the post read.\nIsraeli analysts say the demolition of this tunnel marks a strategic blow to Hamas and \"paves the path to its defeat.\"\n\"The destruction of this tunnel as well as many others like it or similar… as well as other terror facilities pushes Hamas to the edge,\" said Professor Kobi Michael, senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) and the Misgav Institute.\nIDF HOLDS MEMORIAL CEREMONY AT BASE ATTACKED BY HAMAS ON OCT. 7 HONORING FALLEN TROOPS\nThe IDF uncovered one of Gaza's largest underground Hamas infrastructures, stretching 25 meters deep beneath civilian sites, including mosques and schools in Rafah.\n\"It is one of the longest and [most] complicated tunnels that have been discovered, but it is not the only one,\" he told Fox News Digital.\nMichael explained thatHamas’ root tunnelsform the backbone of its underground warfare system.\n\"This is an example of a root tunnel, a strategic one that feeds many tactic tunnels and is used for strategic purposes [such] as command and control, weapon storage, manufacturing platforms of weapon[s] and strategic logistics,\" he said.\nISRAEL SET TO LAUNCH GAZA CITY OFFENSIVE: HIGH STAKES, HIGH COSTS AHEAD\nSmoke rises from Gaza City seen from Deir al-Balah, following intense Israeli military attacks on northern Gaza, on Oct. 5, 2025.(Khames Alrefi/Getty Images)\n\"Such a tunnel is usually manned by hundreds of militants and commanders.\"\nThe IDF believes this particular tunnel network may have been connected to the area whereLt. Hadar Goldin, an Israeli soldier abducted during the 2014 Gaza war, was held captive. Hamas returned Goldin’s remains earlier this month – after more than a decade.\nThe tunnel’s exposure sheds new light on the extent of its underground operations.\nISRAEL’S COVERT CAMPAIGN TARGETS HAMAS TERRORISTS BEHIND OCT 7 MASSACRE\nIsraeli forces destroyed a major Hamas tunnel system in Rafah connected to the area where Lt. Hadar Goldin was held, marking a strategic blow to the militant group's capabilities.\n\"I have no idea about the cost but if you take into consideration the amount of the building materials, labor and facilities and its length, it is a matter of millions of INS,\" he claimed. \"Hamas chose routes under sensitive civilian and humanitarian facilities in order to prevent the IDF from attacking the tunnel.\"\nAsIsrael continues operations in Gaza, the destruction of Hamas’s tunnel networks remains central to its strategy to dismantle the group’s military capabilities and prevent future attacks.\nIn 2014, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he wanted to destroy the tunnels, whichHamas militantsused to infiltrate Israeli territory, \"with or without a ceasefire.\"\nAccording to a 2023 investigation by Reuters, Hamas had said it had been using the tunnels to hide hostages seized in its Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\nIsrael’s military said its ground forces had uncovered around 1,500 Hamas tunnels and shafts throughout the Gaza Strip, perthe report.\nEmma Bussey is a breaking news writer for Fox News Digital.

            "content": "Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon discusses the number of Palestinians killed trying to seek aid and efforts to bring back Israeli hostages on 'Fox News @ Night.'\nCeasefire negotiationsbetween Israel and the Hamas terrorist organization hit a setback Thursday, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recalled Israel’s negotiating delegation from Doha following what officials described as a hardening of Hamas’ demands.\n\"In light of the response Hamas delivered this morning, it has been decided to recall the negotiating team for further consultations in Israel,\" the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement. \"We appreciate the efforts of the mediators, Qatar and Egypt, and the efforts of envoy Steve Witkoff to achieve a breakthrough in the talks.\"\nAccording to reports in Israeli media, the terror group is now demanding the release of 200 Palestinians serving life sentences for murdering Israelis, and an additional 2,000 Palestinians detained in Gaza after Oct. 7. That demand significantly exceeds the previous mediator-backed framework – reportedly accepted byIsrael– which included the release of 125 life-term prisoners and 1,200 other detainees.\nHUCKABEE HITS BACK AT WESTERN COUNTRIES THAT 'SIDE’ WITH TERROR GROUP HAMAS\nPalestinians carry aid supplies from the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, May 29, 2025.(Reuters/Hatem Khaled)\nWitkoff announced on X that his team is returning from Doha \"for consultations after the latest response from Hamas, which clearly shows a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire in Gaza.\"\nHe praised the mediators’ efforts but said, \"Hamas does not appear to be coordinated or acting in good faith.\" Witkoff added, \"We will now consider alternative options to bring the hostages home and try to create a more stable environment for the people of Gaza,\" calling it \"a shame that Hamas has acted in this selfish way.\"\n\"The return of the delegation is not a collapse or a crisis, but the gaps are significant and present across all core issues,\" a senior Israeli official told Channel 12. Another official confirmed to U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff that Hamas’ updated prisoner exchange terms are \"unacceptable.\"\nA joint statement by 25 countries condemning Israel’s conduct in Gaza may have further complicated already fragile ceasefire negotiations, Israeli officials suggested. In response to the condemnation, Israel’s Foreign Ministry issued a sharply worded statement, warning, \"At these sensitive moments in the ongoing negotiations, it is better to avoid statements of this kind.\n\"Israel rejects the joint statement published by a group of countries, as it is disconnected from reality and sends the wrong message to Hamas.\" The ministry added that \"all statements and all claims should be directed at the only party responsible for the lack of a deal for the release of hostages and a ceasefire: Hamas, which started this war and is prolonging it.\"\nHostage familiesexpressed deep concern about the breakdown in negotiations. \"The families are watching with concern as reports emerge about the negotiating team’s return,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement. \"Every day that passes endangers the hostages’ chances of recovery and the ability to locate the dead. Another missed opportunity to bring everyone home would be unforgivable – a moral, security, and diplomatic failure.\"\nThe negotiations, which have dragged on for weeks, are part of a proposed U.S.-backed deal involving a 60-day ceasefire in exchange for the release of some 50 remaining Israeli hostages, a phased release of Palestinian prisoners and expanded humanitarian aid to Gaza.\nHamas terrorists take up positions ahead of a hostage release in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip, Feb. 8, 2025.(AP)\nHamas is also demanding that Israeli troops withdraw to positions held before March 2, when the last ceasefire collapsed, and that the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt reopen in both directions. The group further opposes the newly established U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Fund, demanding that aid distribution return to the previous U.N.-supervised mechanism.\nRelatives and supporters of Israeli hostages held captive in the Gaza Strip since the Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel hold their portraits at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv on May 28, 2025, to mark 600 days of their captivity and demand their release and an end to the war.(Ahmad Gharabli/AFP via Getty Images)\nA Hamas official told Reuters the group is insisting on a return to a Jan. 19 protocol for aid entry, and that ceasefire negotiations must include a clause preventing Israel from resuming military operations after the 60-day truce – even if a broader deal is not reached.\nAt the center of the deadlock is the growing humanitarian crisis. The U.N. and international aid groups warn that hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza face severe food insecurity. It is claimed that civilians in the north have been forced to survive on animal feed and foraged plants, while chaotic aid distributions in the south have repeatedly turned deadly.\nLt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, the chief of the General Staff, conducts a field tour in the Rafah area of the Gaza Strip.(IDF)\nISRAEL ACCEPTS TRUMP-LED CEASEFIRE PLAN THAT COULD END GAZA WAR WITHIN 60 DAYS\nIn response to mounting pressure, Israel is visibly increasing the pace of aid deliveries. On Thursday, COGAT (Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories) reported that 70 aid trucks were transferred into Gaza on Wednesday through the Zikim and Kerem Shalom crossings. The shipments, primarily food, were delivered under IDF coordination withthe U.N.and humanitarian organizations.\nCOGAT said more than 150 trucks were collected inside Gaza, but warned that over 800 trucks remain uncollected at the crossings due to logistical breakdowns on the Palestinian side.\nThe Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) statedon Xthat it offered on Wednesday to deliver the U.N.’s tons of aid sitting in Gaza for free. John Acree, GHF’s interim director, said, \"We’ve seen aid by the U.N. and other organization(s) being piled near the borders but not being delivered.\"\nPrime Minister Netanyahu meets with Steve Witkoff, special envoy to the Middle East.(Prime Minister's Media Adviser)\nIsraeli journalist Nadav Eyalreported Thursdaythat senior defense officials say they’ve been instructed by the political echelon to \"greatly speed up the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza\" and to \"be less concerned with precautions or plans to keep it out of Hamas’ hands.\"\nAs talks stall and military activity resumes, Israeli officials warn that the window for a deal may be closing. \"There are still significant gaps,\" one source told Channel 12. \"The negotiations are not over – but time is running out.\"\nEfrat Lachter is an investigative reporter and war correspondent.

Sharabi told Fox News Digital that while in Australia in June, he met with Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles and Foreign Minister Penny Wong and warned them thatrising antisemitismwould lead to something worse.\nFox News Digital sat down with Sharabi prior to an appearance he made at an event held in support of Magen David Adom, Israel's emergency response organization, in Miami Beach, Fla. During the conversation, Sharabi recalled telling the Australian officials that ahate crimewould take place, and that he would \"see the fears\" of Jewish people walking on the streets. He urged them to speak out against antisemitism before it was too late.\n\"When it happens, a hate crime here, it will be your responsibility, because you have to have a stronger voice against antisemitism,\" Sharabi recalled telling them.\nRABBI KILLED IN SYDNEY HANUKKAH ATTACK HAD WARNED AUSTRALIAN PM ABOUT RISING ANTISEMITISM\nRabbi Yossi Friedman speaks to people gathering at a flower memorial by the Bondi Pavilion at Bondi Beach on Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2025, following a shooting in Sydney, Australia.(Mark Baker/AP Photo)\n\"Unfortunately, it happened. And that's crazy, it's crazy. Really, I'm so sorry for that,\" he said.\nA spokesperson for Wong said that she \"deeply appreciated her meeting with Eli Sharabi and thanks him for sharing his insights and experiences.\"\n\"Minister Wong has consistently condemned antisemitism and antisemitic attacks,\" the spokesperson said. \"In response to the horrific antisemitic terror attack at Bondi, we are further strengthening laws against those who spread antisemitism and online abuse, ensuring our education system properly responds to antisemitism, and lowering the threshold to cancel visas for those who come to Australia to spread antisemitism.\"\nThe spokesperson also conveyed Wong's sympathies to the loved ones of the Bondi Beach shooting victims.\nFox News Digital reached out to Marles' office for comment.\nSharabi told Fox News Digital that theattack on a Hanukkah celebrationat Bondi Beach that left at least 15 dead and dozens wounded reminded him of the persecution of European Jews in the 1940s.\n\"Suddenly you feel like it's the 1940s again, and we are in 2025, 90 years later, all these things are happening again,\" Sharabi said.\nAUSTRALIA ANTI-TERROR POLICE DETAIN 7 MEN AS COUNTRY LAYS YOUNGEST BONDI BEACH VICTIM TO REST\nA member of the Jewish community reacts as he walks with police toward the scene of a shooting at Bondi Beach in Sydney on Dec. 14, 2025.(David Gray/AFP via Getty Images)\nOn Feb. 8, 2025, Sharabi was released from Hamas captivity, 491 days after he was taken hostage from Kibbutz Be'eri during the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre. He did not know until after he was freed that his wife, Lianne, and their daughters, Noiya and Yahel, had been killed when Hamas terrorists attacked Israel.\nSince his release, Sharabi has traveled the world speaking to Jewish communities, world leaders and various audiences about his experience as a hostage, something he recounted in his book, \"Hostage,\" which has been translated into multiple languages.\nIsraeli hostages Or Levy, Eli Sharabi and Ohad Ben Ami were handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross by Hamas under a ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement with Israel, in Deir al Balah, Gaza, on Feb. 8, 2025.(Ashraf Amra/Anadolu via Getty Images)\nAfter he was released, he learned that while he was in the hands of terrorists, there were people around the world praying for him and demanding he and the other hostages be freed.\nHe said that while he was in the hospital in the days following his release, he was slowly exposed to the work that people in Israel and around the world did to advocate for him and the other hostages. It started with revelations about his family and friends, then his realization that people in Israel and around the world also took part in the fight for his release.\nHe soon joined the fight, advocating for the release of all hostages, including Alon Ohel, someone who Sharabi bonded with during his time in captivity.\n\"It was an amazing feeling to see him released. He's like my son,\" Sharabi told Fox News Digital.\nSharabi said that he and Ohel have seen each other a few times as free men and that they try to speak every day.\nEli Sharabi, who spent 491 days in Hamas captivity, and whose wife and two daughters were killed by terrorists, speaks at the United Nations.(Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images)\nOPINION: AUSTRALIA’S HANUKKAH MASSACRE: THE HORROR OF BEING PROVEN RIGHT\nSharabi told Fox News Digital about his life after captivity. Now a free man for nearly a year, he said he appreciates every moment.\n\"First of all, I'm alive. Second, I'm free, and I've learned that freedom is priceless,\" he said. \"Every morning I wake up, I say thank you very much for what I have and for my freedom, and I can be able to choose whatever I do that day and not to ask permission from anyone to eat or drink or speak,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"I'm happy with my life. The memory of my wife, my daughters and my brother will be with me until my last day.\"\nFormer Hamas hostage Eli Sharabi and Israeli U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon hold a photo of Sharabi's family that shows his wife and daughters, all three of whom were murdered on Oct. 7, 2023.(Perry Bindelglass/Israeli U.N. Mission)\nSharabi told Fox News Digital that while in captivity, he promised himself that he would move his family to London, where they could live a peaceful life. He said that he made the decision because of the fear he saw in his daughters' eyes on Oct. 7.\nWhile his plans on relocating to London have changed, Sharabi envisions himself living a quiet life and focusing on his own healing once the body of Ran Gvili, the last remaining hostage in Gaza, is returned to Israel. However, Sharabi said that he cannot go back to Kibbutz Be'eri and that he will likely seek a fresh start a bit further north in central Israel.\n\"I can't go back to Be'eri. It's something I need to solve with myself and with my therapist, of course. How can I get into my house again? For me, living in Be'eri, it's not an option. In every corner, I can see the tragedy,\" Sharabi said. \"I need a new place, a new restart for my life, so it cannot be in Be'eri.\"\nRachel Wolf is a breaking news writer for Fox News Digital and FOX Business.",

            "content": "New aid distribution center established in the Tel al-Sultan area of Gaza. (Video: IDF.)\nThe terrorist group known as Hamas has long plagued theGaza Stripbut is facing a point of crisis as its influence and support, which was already far from sweeping, continues to drop amid internal pressure to end the war and return the hostages taken during the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks.\n\"Hamas’s current posture reveals a critical inflection point in its grip over the Gaza Strip,\" Joe Truzman, a senior research analyst and editor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' Long War Journal and an expert on Palestinian terrorist groups, told Fox News Digital. \"By opposing the new aid distribution mechanism, one that is coordinated by the U.S. and Israel, Hamas is signaling that its primary concern is not the well-being of Palestinians but the preservation of its authority.\"\nDespite the monthslong aid blockade on the Gaza Strip byIsraeland the images of starvation, Hamas this week threatened any Palestinian civilians who accept food aid for their families and warned they \"will pay the price, and we will take the necessary measures.\"\nDisplaced Palestinians line up pans to collect hot food from a charity food distribution center in Gaza City, northern Gaza, on Tuesday, May 27, 2025.(Photographer: Ahmad Salem/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\nHAMAS TERROR GROUP REPORTEDLY BUCKLING UNDER FINANCIAL STRAIN AMID ISRAELI MILITARY GAINS AND GROWING UNREST\nDespite the threats, Palestinians have flooded theaid siteserected by the U.S.-Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), reportedly resulting in scenes of chaos as desperate civilians overran one distribution location on Tuesday. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its \"troops fired warning shots in the area outside the compound,\" adding, \"Control over the situation was established … and the safety of IDF troops was not compromised.\"\nThe U.N. Human Rights Office claimed some 47 people were injured during the gunfire, while the Hamas-run health ministry said one person was killed and 48 others were wounded, reported theBBC, though Fox News Digital could not independently verify the casualty count.\nOn Wednesday, GHF said in a statement that, contrary to reports, no Palestinians have been questioned or detained while receiving aid. Additionally, GHF said that no Palestinians had been shot or killed while trying to get aid.\n\"As we have repeatedly cautioned, there are many parties who wish to see GHF fail. Their goal is to force a return to the status quo, even if it means risking lifesaving aid to the people of Gaza,\" the GHF said in a statement. \"Reports to the contrary originated from Hamas and are inaccurate.\"\nHamas fighters stand in formation as Palestinians gather on a street to watch the handover of three Israeli hostages to a Red Cross team in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza, on February 8, 2025(Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nTruzman explained that it is in Hamas interest to portray the aid delivery as negatively as possible, and to use the chaos to promote itsreturn to power.\n\"Hamas had significant influence over aid flows, which it used not only for governance but also as leverage to reinforce loyalty, reward patronage networks, and maintain internal control,\" the expert explained. \"The erosion of this influence poses both a symbolic and operational threat to the group.\n\"With Hamas becoming sidelined from the aid process, the group is facing a legitimacy crisis,\" Truzman added.\nDespite the chaotic scenes that arose as aid finally returned to Gaza, the GHF said Tuesday that it had distributed about 8,000 food boxes totaling 462,000 meals so far.\nDisplaced Palestinian children wait to receive a free meal from a charity food distribution center in Gaza City, northern Gaza, on Tuesday, May 27, 2025.(Photographer: Ahmad Salem/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\nOn Wednesday, eight trucks worth of aid were delivered, which equates to some 378,262 meals.\n\"Operations will continue to scale up tomorrow,\" the GHF confirmed.\nOne Gazan told the Center for Peace Communications that the failure of Hamas, which serves as the local government, to secure affordable and accessible food has driven civilians to the American distribution site.\n\"In fact, they were good to us,\" he said. \"They were handing out rations cards and started to tell us to take them. Unlike those ruling Gaza who don't do anything for us.\n\"We, as a people, are telling you that we need anyone, anyone who can provide us with these necessities,\" he added. \"Otherwise, no one would be going to the American distribution point. If Hamas is listening to us, get off the people's backs.\nISRAELI AMBASSADOR SLAMS UN'S 'MAFIA-LIKE' TACTICS AGAINST US-BACKED GAZA FOUNDATION\nIn recent months, civilian populations have not only been turning to external actors for relief where possible, they haveincreasingly called on Hamasto return the hostages, stop the war and even leave the Gaza Strip.\n\"This shift undermines Hamas’s image as the authority in Gaza and exposes its weakened state,\" Truzman said.\n\"However, any assumption that Hamas might yield under these conditions must be tempered by the nature of its surviving leadership,\" he warned. \"Those who remain at the helm are among the most ideologically entrenched and militarily committed members of the organization.\"\nHamas took over the Gaza Strip in 2007 after it defeated its rival party, Fatah, which is part of the Palestine Liberation Organization.\nDespite the plurality vote nearly two decades ago, Hamas has struggled to maintain control and stability for years and its support – even in the lead up to the 2023 attacks that prompted the largest-ever war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza – was reportedly lacking and its leadership growing increasingly unpopular.\nBritish volunteer doctor Victoria Rose, left, is seen working at Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, Gaza, on May 25, 2025.((Photo by Alaa Y. M. Abumohsen/Anadolu via Getty Images)\nISRAEL BLOCKS HUMANITARIAN AID INTO GAZA AFTER HAMAS REJECTS CEASEFIRE EXTENSION PROPOSAL\nIsrael and Egypt have limited the flow of goods into the Gaza Strip for the last two decades, and border crossing restrictions have been heavily enforced since the 1980s. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2025.\nHowever, according to a report by theWilson Center, only a fraction of the population prior to the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks blamed food shortages on external factors like sanctions, while a third blamed the Hamas-run government for mismanagement, while another quarter of the population blamed inflation.\nThe report also found that nearly half of Palestinian civilians said they had no trust in Hamas' leadership, while roughly a third of the population threw their support behind the group.\nSupport isbelieved to have droppedin the nearly 600 days that followed the Oct. 7, 2023 terror attacks, and the subsequent devastation brought to the Gaza Strip.\nDisplaced Palestinians wait to receive a free meal from a charity food distribution center in Gaza City, northern Gaza, on Tuesday, May 27, 2025.(Photographer: Ahmad Salem/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\"If the new aid mechanism succeeds in improving living conditions for Palestinians, surpassing what Hamas has been able to provide during wartime, it is unlikely to reverse the growing public dissatisfaction with the group,\" Truzman told Fox News Digital. \"Even an imperfect but externally managed aid system may further expose Hamas’s governance failures, particularly its prioritization of power retention over the welfare of the population.\n\"While tangible improvements will take time to materialize, the mere perception that life can improve without Hamas may be enough to shift public attitudes further against the group,\" he added.\nCaitlin McFall is a Reporter at Fox News Digital covering Politics, U.S. and World news.",

            "content": "FOX News' Greg Palkot reports the latest on the Israel-Hamas war.\nThe Israeli military has assembled several large pumps it could use to flood the Hamas tunnels beneath the Gaza Strip with seawater, driving out terrorists hiding there,The Wall Street Journalreported, citing U.S. officials.\nConstruction of five large seawater pumps was completed in November about one mile north of the Al-Shati refugee camp. Each pump is capable of drawing water from the Mediterranean Sea and can move thousands of cubic meters of water per hour, which would flood the tunnels within weeks, the report said.\nIsrael has not yet committed to the plan, and it is unclear whether it would attempt to flood the tunnels while there are still hostages, including Americans, held by Hamas. The Palestinian terror group took some 240 people captive duringthe Oct. 7 attack on Israeland brought them back to the Gaza Strip.\nAccording to the report, Israel has identified about 800 tunnels beneath Gaza that Hamas has used to move fighters, store weapons and plan terror attacks on Israel.

The Israeli military said it launched its 10,000th airstrike against the terror group in the Gaza Strip late Sunday.\nIsrael has vowed to do everything it can to protect civilians as it targets Hamas and its network of tunnels. Many of the 10,000 airstrikes have been aimed at destroying Hamas' underground labyrinth.\nThe IDF saysit has struck over 400 separate Hamas targets since the cease-fire agreement collapsed on Friday. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Sunday that Hamas was to blame for the end of the cease-fire, because they did not release \"additional women and children that we know that they are holding, and they're refusing to let go.\"\n\"Our policy is clear — we will forcefully strike any threat posed against our territory,\" IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a statement.\nFox News Digital's Anders Hagstrom contributed to this report.\nChris Pandolfo is a breaking news reporter for Fox News Digital.

(Keshet News 12.)\nThe al-Ahali Hospital in Gaza City was struck Tuesday night, and hundreds were reportedly killed in the blast. Hamas initially claimed the hospital was attacked in an Israeli strike; Israel countered after an investigation that it was hit by an errant missile launched by terrorists in Gaza itself.\nOnline video making the rounds on social media suggests the al-AhaliHospital in Gaza Citywas not directly hit by a rocket on Tuesday, but instead the missile appears to have struck a nearby parking lot, leading to many conflicting claims of who was responsible, where the missile struck and how many people died.\nHamas was targeting Tel Aviv with rocket fire on Tuesday, and has been targeting central Israel multiple times each day.\nISRAELI TV FOOTAGE APPEARS TO SHOW GAZA HOSPITAL BLAST CAME FROM PALESTINIAN ROCKET\nPalestinians check the place of the explosion at al-Ahli hospital, in Gaza City, Wednesday, Oct. 18, 2023.

According to the Palestinian authorities, Israeli army is responsible for the deadly bombing.(Ali Jadallah/Anadolu via Getty Images)\nWhile Israel rebutted the claims immediately,President Biden, who was in Israel on Wednesday, stated intelligence from the Pentagon supports Israel’s assertion that the blast originated from rocket fire in Gaza.\nBiden reiterated his belief that Israel was not to blame later on Wednesday. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson also reaffirmed the U.S. position.\n\"While we continue to collect information, our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday,\" she wrote.\nBIDEN FACES ULTIMATE TEST AS IRAN, WHICH BACKS HAMAS, WARNS OF DEADLY CONSEQUENCES\nPalestinians carry belongings leave al-Ahli hospital, which they were taking it as a shelter, in Gaza City, Wednesday, Oct. 18, 2023.

Moments later, a blast is seen in Gaza midway along the rockets' trajectory.\nISRAEL-HAMAS WAR: BIDEN TO VISIT ISRAEL ON WEDNESDAY IN SHOW OF SUPPORT\nImages and video making the rounds on social media tell a different story from the one Hamas initially told.\nThe images depict a parking lot with several damaged cars, and in the middle, a divot from where an object exploded.\nHAMAS CAPTURED AMERICAN MOM, DAUGHTER ON ISRAEL TRIP, RABBI SAYS\nGAZA CITY, GAZA - OCTOBER 18: A girl tries to collect usable belongings amid wreckage of vehicles after Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital was hit in Gaza City, Gaza on October 18, 2023.

Reports said among the dead were five journalists who worked for outlets such as Reuters, The Associated Press, and Al Jazeera.\n\"Israel deeply regrets the tragic mishap that occurred today at the Nasser Hospital in Gaza,\" Netanyahu's office said in a statement.\n\"Israel values the work of journalists, medical staff and all civilians.

Gen. Effie Defrin echoed Netanyahu’s comments, stressing that the military makes every effort to mitigate civilian harm while ensuring troop safety.\n\"We are operating in an extremely complex reality. Hamas terrorists deliberately use civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, as shields,\" Defrin said in a video posted to social media. \"They have even operated from the Nasser Hospital itself.

            "content": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discusses the ongoing conflict with Hamas, the food crisis in Gaza as Israel intends to take control of the region, efforts to secure the release of the remaining hostages and more.\nIsrael’s security cabinet early Friday approved a plan to occupy Gaza City, marking an escalation inIsrael'songoing war against Hamas.\nThe announcement comes after an all-night meeting of the security cabinet, following Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu’sannouncement that Israel planned to retake control over the entire territory and eventually hand it off to friendly Arab forces opposed to Hamas.\n\"The Security Cabinet has approved the Prime Minister's proposal for defeating Hamas. The IDF will prepare for taking control of Gaza City while distributing humanitarian assistance to the civilian population outside the combat zones,\" read a post from the official X account of the Prime Minister of Israel.\nThe office said the Security Cabinet had adopted, by vote, five principles for concluding the war which include: the disarming of Hamas, the return of all hostages – living and deceased, the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip, Israeli security control in the Gaza Strip, and the establishment of an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority.\nAP ROASTED OVER ‘JAW-DROPPING’ STORY ABOUT HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS' ‘STRUGGLE TO RECOVER’ FROM PAGER ATTACK\nIsrael’s Security Cabinet early Friday approved a plan to occupy Gaza City, marking an escalation in the nearly two-year war between Israel and Hamas.(Ali Jadallah/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\"A decisive majority of Security Cabinet ministers believed that the alternative plan that had been submitted to the Security Cabinet would neither achieve the defeat of Hamas nor the return of the hostages,\" the prime minister's office said.\nIsrael has bombardedGaza Cityrepeatedly since Oct. 7, 2023 massacre in addition to carrying out numerous raids. Today, it is one of the few areas of Gaza that hasn’t been turned into an Israeli buffer zone or placed under evacuation orders.\nFROM HOMEROOM TO HATE: HOW JEWISH STUDENTS ARE FACING A NEW KIND OF PRESSURE IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS\nHundreds of thousands have fled Gaza City since the start of the war, but many returned during a ceasefire earlier this year.\nAsked in an interview with Fox News ahead of the Security Cabinet meeting if Israel would \"take control of all of Gaza,\" Netanyahu replied: \"We intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there, enable the population to be free of Gaza.\"\nDestroyed buildings lie in Gaza, as seen from the Israeli side of the border, July 28, 2025.(Reuters)\n\"We don't want to keep it. We want to have a security perimeter,\" Netanyahu said in the interview. \"We want to hand it over to Arab forces that will govern it properly without threatening us and giving Gazans a good life.\"\nThe prospect of a full military occupation of Gaza comes 20 years after Israel's full disengagement from the enclave when, as part of the country's unilateral disengagement, the government forcibly removed around 8,600 Jewish residents from the area. Shortly after, Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections and staged a violent coup to overthrow the Palestinian Authority and seize control of the Gaza Strip.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatens legal action against The New York Times, accusing the paper of defamation over its Gaza coverage.(Jacquelyn Martin/Getty Images)\nHamas-led militants abducted 251 people and killed around 1,200 in the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre that triggered the war. Since then, more than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's retaliatory offensive according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.\nMost of the hostages have been released in ceasefire deals but 50 remain inside Gaza. The Israeli government believes around 20 of them are still alive.\nFox News' Amelie Botbol and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\nBradford Betz is a Fox News Digital breaking reporter covering crime,political issues,and much more.",

            "content": "The 'FOX & Friends' co-host spoke with individuals who watched the footage to get their initial reaction to Hamas' brutality.\nJERUSALEM — Over the past few weeks, I have watched from Israel as a 43-minute film containing raw footage of Hamas terrorists' Oct. 7 massacre in southern Israel makes its way around the world.\nThe extreme and horrified reactions in Congress,the United Nationsand even in Hollywood to the film — a compilation of body cameras worn by Hamas terrorists, dashcams, traffic cameras, closed-circuit TV and the mobile phones and social media accounts of victims, soldiers and emergency medical workers — have not surprised me.\nThis is the nightmare Israelis have been living for the past seven weeks since thousands of Hamas and other Palestinian terrorists from the Gaza Strip infiltrated Israel on that fateful Saturday morning — now referred to as \"Black Saturday\" — attacking some 20 civilian communities, army bases and a music festival.\nISRAELI POLICE SAY EXTREME SEXUAL VIOLENCE, RAPE BY HAMAS TERRORISTS WAS SYSTEMATIC\nA picture taken Oct. 11, 2023, shows covered bodies at kibbutz Beeri near the border with Gaza, the site of an infiltration by Hamas terrorists Oct 7.(Menahem Kahana/AFP via Getty Images)\nMore than 1,200 people were brutally murdered in the attack, and another 200-plus were taken hostage, including nearly 40 children and a dozen mothers.\nEven the headiest of individuals struggle to stomach such a compilation of horror.\n\"We want the world to see the atrocities that Hamas did during the Oct. 7 massacre, and we urge the world not to look away,\" Lior Hiatt, spokesperson of Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told Fox News Digital Thursday.\n\"When we say that Hamas is worse than ISIS, this is exactly what we mean,\" he said. \"It is a very difficult film to watch. It is the raw footage taken by the terrorists themselves and shows very graphic images.\"\nHiatt said that the film has been shown to diplomats, international organizations, influencers and decision-makers at the highest levels, shared by Israel in more than 60 of its embassies and consulates around the world.\nIsraeli army soldiers search the remains of a torched vehicle for forensic evidence at the site of the Oct. 7 attack on the Supernova desert music festival by Palestinian terrorists near kibbutz Reim in the Negev desert in southern Israel Oct. 13, 2023.(Jack Guez/AFP via Getty Images)\n\"Not everyone can actually stay and watch the entire movie,\" the spokesman said. \"I’ve seen people crying, I’ve seen people leaving the room and I’ve seen a lot of people shocked to see that those kinds of atrocities were committed against human beings by the monsters from Hamas.\"\nThose who are invited to see the film are forbidden from entering with personal cameras or cellphones. According to the Israeli army, which put the footage together, this is not a film that will be released to the general public. The reason, officials say, is many of the individuals seen clearly in the film did not survive the attack, and their relatives have requested it only be shown to people who can make a real difference.\nSENIOR GOP CONGRESSMAN FELT 'SICK' AFTER VIEWING FOOTAGE OF HAMAS ATTACKS IN CLOSED-DOOR BRIEFING\nSplit image of Hamas terrorists with civilian body bags.(Yousef Masoud/Majority World/Universal Images Group and Amir Levy/Getty Images)\nIn Congress, the footage was seen last week by an audience of about 300, reportedly including\"Squad\" memberRep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez., D-N.Y. While she's been vocal with criticism of Israel on X, formerly Twitter, and on her congressional website, she doesn't seem to have made any comment, but the reactions from other members of Congress were similar to when I saw it in Israel.\n\"I’ve seen decapitation and I've seen just beating and beating on both dead and alive bodies,\" said California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, who spoke with Fox News Digital after watching footage. \"And, quite frankly, I'm just sick to my stomach.\"\nNew York Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres, who saw the film this week at a different screening, wrote on X, \"I find myself haunted by the cries of two children witnessing their father die from an explosion after a Hamas terrorist throws a grenade inside their shelter. Suffering the savagery of Hamas feels like a fate worse than death. The fatherless child is seen crying in agony ‘Why am I still alive?’\"\nIndeed, that scene, captured on a family’s private webcam, is particularly upsetting, but it’s not the only section that is the stuff of nightmares. A selection of still photographs taken as forensic evidence shows unidentifiable human bodies, including babies still in their pajamas, beaten, burned and unimaginably mutilated, including evidence of gender-based crimes, which Fox News Digital has detailed in previous stories.\nHamas terrorists killed at least 1,400 civilians, including women, children and the elderly, when they attacked Israel Oct. 7.(Israel Defense Forces via AP)\nEqually horrific is the footage taken from the cellphones of victims who most likely did not survive or were taken hostage, including a group of young female soldiers sheltering in a bomb shelter seconds before a gun-wielding terrorist walks calmly inside and begins shooting. In another clip, blood-dripping partygoers from the festival are seen blown to bits by the terrorist’s grenades.\nUNITED NATIONS SLAMMED FOR SILENCE OVER HAMAS RAPES, MUTILATION AND MURDER OF ISRAELI WOMEN, CRITICS SAY\nThis image from undated bodycam video footage taken by a downed Hamas terrorist and released by Israel Defense Forces shows a Hamas militant walking around a residential neighborhood at an undisclosed location in southern Israel.(Israel Defense Forces via AP)\nAnother aspect that is perhaps most jarring, however, is the footage taken by the terrorists themselves. Many of those who carried out the barbaric attack wore bodycams with the explicit goal of documenting their atrocities, most likely as a way to further terrorize and torment the Israeli public,ISIS-style, long after the attack.\nThey filmed themselves hunting down civilians both in their homes and on the streets of southern Israel, in rural communal farms and in the towns of Sderot and Ofakim, which sit just a few miles from the border with Gaza.\nIn one particularly awful moment, a group of elderly people is gunned down and mutilated on the pavement next to their minibus. In another scene, we see a Hamas terrorist screaming \"Allahu Akhbar,\" as he relentlessly hacks the head off a Thai laborer with a hatchet.\nAlso interspersed throughout the footage, we see snippets of exhilaratedterrorists celebratingtheir heinous acts, including the joyous celebration as they dragged the decapitated bodies of Israeli soldiers and civilians through the streets of Gaza.\nA soldier of the Military Rabbinate unit opens a container filled with bodies killed during the Hamas attack on the Israeli southern border as the process of identifying the dead continues in the Shura army base Oct. 24, 2023, in Ramle, Israel.(Amir Levy/Getty Images)\nIn my screening, which was for journalists, no one walked out in the middle, but no one spoke much afterward. The question of how humans could do this to other human beings hung heavy in the air inside the auditorium.\nMaayan Hoffman, The Jerusalem Post’s deputy CEO, who was at that screening, told Fox News Digital she believed more people should see the footage.\nA man holds a banner displaying photos of kidnapped Israelis at a rally in Times Square demanding Hamas free Israeli hostages Oct. 19, 2023, in New York City.(Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\n\"It is extremely important for more people to see the film because it’s difficult to really understand the barbaric behavior and the joy these terrorists had while they were hurting other people,\" she said.\n\"I’ve been to southern Israel since Oct. 7, and I have also been at the forensic labs, but this film really brings it all together,\" said Hoffman, also a senior correspondent for the newspaper.\n\"It also gives us a better understanding of what the victims and families of the hostages went through on that day.\"\nRuth Marks Eglash is a veteran journalist based inJerusalem, Israel.

            "content": "Greg Palkot reports on the latest developments from Israel, as the IDF moves deeper into Gaza city.\nI’ve been reporting from the Mideast for some 25 years now. And that hackneyed cliche still works: \"The more things change, the more they stay the same.\"\nWhich is not to say the three weeks we’ve stayed here this time have been dull. There have been more ups and downs than a run-down roller coaster at an old Luna Park.\nOur first field shoot was, appropriately, enough to visit released hostages and families of captives ofHamas. Because, for the majority of Israelis, this is one of the most important topics. 48 people held by terrorists, 20 still alive. Their time of imprisonment, the nearly two years of this Gaza war.\nSPAIN'S PRIME MINISTER SPARKS OUTRAGE OVER ALLEGED NUCLEAR THREAT AGAINST ISRAEL\nGreg Palkot with released hostage Keith Siegel in Tel Aviv September 2025(Ben Jary)\nWe met the families on Day 700 of the hostages’ captivity. Lishay Lava-Mira begged for her husband Omri to come home. Liron Berman was sure his twin brothers would make it, (\"They’re strong.\") And Keith Siegel, a hostage, himself, for close to 500 days, articulate and healthy, looked beyond the Israeli government for help. \"I call upon Trump to continue his efforts.\"\nEarly in our stay, there was hope a new peace plan from theU.S.might gain traction. All 48 hostages would be released in exchange for 3,000 Palestinian prisoners, and a cease-fire to assess the next steps.\nThat seemingly reasonable plan took hits left, right and center.\nCRUZ SLAMS UN'S ISRAEL ‘GENOCIDE’ CHARGE, PUSHES FOR CONSEQUENCES\nFirst, a horror we learned about as we’d finished a quick breakfast at our hotel. Two gunmen shooting up a busy commuter bus and bus stop in Jerusalem, leaving six dead and many more injured. The scenes were horrific and the actions to eliminate theterroristsbrave.\nThen the next morning, as cameraman Ben and I were doing a routine round-up of the news on the hotel balcony we call home, I noticed in the corner of my eye longtime and dedicated producer Yael inside our studio room jumping up and down.\nIsrael had done the unthinkable, targeting Hamas leadership in what should have been the neutral zone of Doha, Qatar. The militants claimed they were discussing the peace plan at the time. That U.S. proposal became as dead as any victims the Israelis managed to hit [apparently no leadership].\nAnd then to put the final \"paid\" to peace talks. The much-touted full-scale ground invasion of Gaza City by Israel was launched. To finish off some 3,000 remaining Hamas fighters and their infrastructure.  As Netanyahu put it, \"What starts in Gaza (the ugly Hamas massacre and hostage-taking of Oct. 7.) ends in Gaza.\"\nThe Chief of the General Staff, LTG Eyal Zamir, conducted a field tour in the Gaza Strip.(IDF Spokesman's Unit)\nAnd this is when the frustration sets in for grizzled combat reporters like me, and our top-notch war team of camera Ben, Producer Yael and Security Rob. As they have throughout the war, Israel limiting access to the Gaza action.\nSo we depend on local journalists to show us the horror. The destroyed urban scene. And most importantly, the vast and ugly images of human suffering. Hundreds of thousands of civilians, many not Hamas supporters, having to deal with the living hell that the terrorists and the fighting have imposed on them.\nRemember that line, \"I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy\"? Well, maybe I’d go with it regarding Hamas, but not these poor Palestinian children, who know nothing of the geopolitics of the situation.\nA Gazan family walk near the rubble of buildings during the Eid al-Adha holiday, in Gaza City, June 6, 2025.(Mahmoud Issa/Reuters)\nTo their credit, IDF officials tell us they are moving slowly through the lunar landscape that is now Gaza. Careful not to endanger civilians and /or hostages. Somehow, with Hamas-backed local health officials indicating 65,000 have already been killed after two years of war, it seems somewhat after the fact.\nBut that means, again, according to the officials we’ve spoken to, this whole Gaza City process could take as long as four months to complete. Too long for the morale-sapped reservists fighting the war. Too long for the inhabitants enduring it all. Too long for the desperate hostages.\nGreg Palkot with Fox News security Rob Gray and camerman Ben Jary.(Greg Palkot)\nNo wonder the locals here look toPresident Donald Trumpand/or a range of countries, bodies, figures (yes, Pope Leo) to try to intercede beyond the local leaders, Israel’s past duels with foes like Hezbollah and Iran seemed like well-tuned 21st century war-making. The fighting in Gaza is more like early 20th century ugly World War I trench warfare.\nIn between our live shots and reporting in Tel Aviv, we occasionally nip out to a few of the bars and restaurants that dot this seaside metropolis, which, despite all, running full tilt. And wonder what this country would be like, as well, of course, what it would be like for the diverse Palestinian population without the yoke of war around their shoulders.\nGreg Palkot serves as a London-based senior foreign affairs correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC). He joined the network in 1998 as a correspondent.",

            "content": "Ela Shani joins 'FOX & Friends' to explain how she felt when her cousin was released by Hamas and share her story of surviving the Oct. 7 attack on her kibbutz.\nIn the early hours of October 7, 2023, the Idan family of Kibbutz Nahal Oz was shattered when Hamas terrorists infiltrated their home. As the family tried to take refuge in their safe room, the terrorists murdered their eldest daughter, Maayan, in front of her parents and siblings, and thenabducted the father, Tzachi. The scene was broadcast live on social media, forcing the nation to witness their agonizing last moments.\nAt the same time, in Kibbutz Holit, 16-year-old Rotem Matias lay hiding under his mother's lifeless body, texting his sisters the heartbreaking news: \"Mom and Dad are dead. Sorry.\"\nIn Kfar Aza, Roee Idan was killed while holding his 3-year-old daughter, Abigail, as his older children watched in horror. Their mother, Smadar, was also shot before their eyes. Afterward, the children hid in a closet, trapped with their mother’s body, unsure of their younger sister's fate, who was later abducted into Gaza.\nISRAELI POLICE SAY EXTREME SEXUAL VIOLENCE, RAPE BY HAMAS TERRORISTS WAS SYSTEMATIC\nA bloodied handprint stains a wall in a Nir Oz house after Hamas terrorists attacked this kibbutz days earlier near the border of Gaza.(Alexi J. Rosenfeld/Getty Images)\nThese are just a few of the countless stories documented in anew reportreleased on Tuesday, co-authored by Dr. Cochav Elkayam-Levy, founder of the Civil Commission on October 7th Crimes Against Women and Children, and Dr. Michal Gilad and Dr. Ilya Rudyak. The report introduces the term \"kinocide\" to describe the systematic targeting and destruction of family units during the attack- an unprecedented atrocity that goes beyond typical warfare.\n\"A crime without a name for victims without a voice,\" as Dr. Elkayam-Levy described it. \"The perpetrators not only killed but deliberately sought to destroy the very foundation of human society: the family.\"\n\"The hardest crimes to witness were those involving families,\" Dr. Elkayam-Levy continued, \"While theHamas perpetratorscelebrated their violence, chanting religious slogans and broadcasting their actions on social media, the terror was not confined to the immediate victims-it was amplified globally.\"\n\"The use of social media was crucial in spreading the terror, inspiring similar acts of violence elsewhere,\" Merav Israeli-Amarant, CEO of the Civil Commission, told Fox News Digital. She referred to this tactic as the \"terror theater\" a term coined by legal scholar Tehila Schwartz Altshuler, explaining how the broadcasts were designed to radicalize and incite other terrorists.\nIsraeli soldiers remove the bodies of civilians who were killed days earlier in an attack by Palestinian terrorists on this kibbutz near the border with Gaza, on Oct. 10, 2023 in Kfar Aza, Israel.(Photo by Amir Levy/Getty Images)\nAs Elkayam-Levy and her team dug deeper, they realized that similar tactics have been documented in conflicts across the globe, from Argentina and Iraq to Syria, Sierra Leone and Myanmar. \"We’ve been in contact with survivors of kinocide,including Yazidis, who have shared their experiences. The pain is universal. This has happened before, but it never had a name,\" Dr. Elkayam-Levy said.\nIn collaboration with the Raoul Wallenberg Center for Human Rights, the commission worked to identify these patterns of abuse and ensure that kinocide is recognized as a distinct crime. The new report, released after a year of research, includes interviews with survivors, visits to the sites where the atrocities took place, and an extensive review of evidence. The goal is to bring kinocide into international legal discourse, advocating for its urgent need to be recognized as a distinct crime.\n'I WILL BE HAUNTED FOREVER’: ISRAEL’S HORRIFIC VIDEO OF HAMAS ATROCITIES LEAVES VIEWERS SHOCKED AND SICKENED\nA woman breaks down at the memorial to Yulia Waxer Daunov as family members and friends of the lost and kidnapped gather at the site of the Nova Festival to mark the one-year anniversary of the attacks by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2024 in Re'im, Israel.(Leon Neal/Getty Images)\nProfessor Irwin Cotler, former Minister of Justice of Canada and International Chair of the Raoul Wallenberg Center for Human Rights, stated, \"Silence in the face of such evil is not neutrality; it is complicity. Worse still, there has been denial, justification, and even the glorification of these heinous acts, underscoring the moral and legal imperative to act decisively against such crimes. The dangers of antisemitism are not just the oldest and most lethal of hatreds- they are also a presage of global evil, as evidenced by the events of October 7.\"\n\"We need an international coalition to address this systematic targeting of families,\" Elkayam-Levy said. \"But international law hasfailed the survivorsof October 7. The current legal frameworks do not adequately protect families in these kinds of attacks.\"\nAn Israeli couple holding their national flag walk in front of graffiti calling for the release of Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas terrorists in southern Israel, in Jerusalem on Nov. 18, 2023.(GIL COHEN-MAGEN/AFP via Getty Images)\nThe report, which has been endorsed by international law experts and human rights activists worldwide, highlights the urgent need for legal and social recognition of kinocide. However, despite the report’s widespread endorsement, Elkayam-Levy expressed her concern over the international community’s response.\nAs someone who faced the denial of prominent figures in the international human rights community in response to her lastreport on sexual violenceon Oct. 7, she said, \"We live in dark times when international law is weaponized against us (Israelis) in terrifying ways. As an international human rights scholar, I never imagined that we would live in a time when such abuse is directed at us. It really scares me.\"\nEfrat Lachter is an investigative reporter and war correspondent. Her work has taken her to 40 countries, including Ukraine, Russia, Iraq, Syria, Sudan and Afghanistan.

            "content": "Former IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus discusses Israel's boycott of cease-fire negotiations.\nJERUSALEM - In a report published by the U.N. Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, the international body finally recognized that Hamas terrorists carried out extreme acts of sexual violence on Oct. 7, including rape and gang-rape in at least three locations. It also noted that in some of the incidents, the victims were subjected to rape and were then killed; in others, Hamas terrorists raped the women after they were killed.\nDespite the recognition, Israel expressed disappointment that the report stopped short of condemning Hamas’ heinous acts outright or even convening a special hearing in the Security Council to discuss taking action against the group – and its supporters.\nIsrael’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, accused the U.N. of downplaying the atrocities and ordered the country’s special representative, Ambassador Gilad Erdan, to return to Israel for \"consultations.\"\nUnited Nations headquarters and flag juxtaposed with a picture of an Israeli woman kidnapped by Hamas terrorists.(Getty Images/Telegram)\nHAMAS TERRORISTS 'SYSTEMATICALLY AND INTENTIONALLY' COMMITTED SEXUAL VIOLENCE DURING OCT. 7 ATTACK: REPORT\n\"I have ordered our ambassador to the U.N. Gilad Erdan to return to Israel for immediate consultations regarding the attempt to silence the serious U.N. report on the mass rapes committed by Hamas and its aides on October 7th,\" the Minister wrote in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\"Despite the authority granted to him, the U.N. Secretary General did not order the convening of the Security Council in view of the findings or declare Hamas a terrorist organization and impose sanctions on its supporters,\" wrote Katz.\n\"It took the U.N. five months to finally acknowledge the shocking sex crimes committed during the Hamas terror attack on Oct.7,\" Erdan said in a statement. \"Today, with the release of the report on the sexual abuse that Israeli female hostages are enduring, the shame of the U.N. is on clear display. The U.N. has not held even one discussion on the topic. Not even one meeting.\"\nHamas terrorists killed at least 1,200 civilians, including women, children and the elderly, when they attacked Israel on Oct. 7.(Israel Defense Forces via AP)\nErdan called on the secretary-general, and the Security Council, to immediately condemn Hamas for its crimes, and apply unrelenting pressure on the terrorists to ensure that their sexual abuse ends and that the hostages are released.\nCalls for a cease-fire, he said, would prolong the suffering of Israeli hostages at the hands of Hamas and allow Hamas \"to continue their sexual violence.\"\nThe report was carried out by Pramila Patten, the special representative of the secretary-general, who visited Israel with a team of experts last month. In a statement to the press, she noted that the mission \"found clear and convincing information that sexual violence, including rape, sexualized torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment has been committed against hostages.\"\nUNITED NATIONS SLAMMED FOR SILENCE OVER HAMAS RAPES, MUTILATION AND MURDER OF ISRAELI WOMEN, CRITICS SAY\nA soldier with the Military Rabbinate unit opens a container filled with bodies of people killed during the Hamas terrorist attack on the Shura army base, on Oct. 24, 2023, in Ramle, Israel.(Amir Levy/Getty Images)\nShe also highlighted that there were \"reasonable grounds to believe that such violence may be ongoing against those still held in captivity.\"\n\"The mission team also found a pattern of victims, mostly women, found fully or partially naked, bound, and shot across multiple locations,\" Patten said in the press statement, adding that \"although circumstantial, such a pattern may be indicative of some forms of sexual violence, including sexualized torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.\"\nThousands of Palestinians led by terrorists fromHamas’ elite Nukbah forcebroke through the border fence from the Gaza Strip, infiltrating into Israel on Oct. 7, murdering more than 1,200 people on multiple army bases, towns, villages and at a music festival taking place in the area.\nAside from the murders and rapes, terrorists also took hostage some 240 individuals, including babies, children, women and the elderly. More than 134 people are still being held captive some five months later, with Israelis expressing particular concern for the welfare of the remaining female hostages, who they believe are being attacked sexually while in captivity.\nIn his briefing on Monday, the Israeli army spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, shared an intercepted voice recording of an elementary school teacher employed in a Gaza school run by UNRWA, the U.N. agency that services Palestinian refugees, bragging about kidnapping an Israeli woman during the Oct. 7 attack.\nAn IDF infographic with descriptions of what it claims are the UNRWA workers who took part in the Oct 7 massacre.(IDF Spokesman's Unit)\nHagari pointed out that the man uses an Arabic term also used by ISIS terrorists when that group carried out atrocities, including rape, against the Yazidi community in Iraq between 2014-2016.\nIn the chilling recordingHagari identified the school teacher as Yussef Zidan Suleiman Al-Hawajara and, with English subtitles translating the Arabic, Al-Hawajara can be heard describing in detail how he entered Israel and is now holding an Israeli woman captive.\n\"On the call you can hear him bragging about ‘sabaya’ a female captive, he is talking about one of our girls, about one of our women,\" Hagari said in his briefing, pointing out that \"sabaya\" is an Arabic term meaning female captive and that it was the same terminology used by ISIS.\n'I WILL BE HAUNTED FOREVER’: ISRAEL’S HORRIFIC VIDEO OF HAMAS ATROCITIES LEAVES VIEWERS SHOCKED AND SICKENED\nAn Israeli soldier patrols near Kibbutz Beeri in southern Israel on Oct. 12, 2023, close to the place where 270 revellers were killed by terrorists during the Supernova music festival on Oct. 7.(Aris Messinis/AFP via Getty Images)\nHagari said the call was intercepted by the military on Oct. 7 and had just been declassified in order to highlight the involvement of employees from the controversial aid agency, which Israelis believe serves to perpetuate the decades-old intractable conflict and turns a blind eye to Hamas’ terror activities.\nNaming several additional UNRWA employees, Hagari said the army had evidence that as many as 450 UNRWA workers were active members of terror groups in the Gaza Strip.\nIn January, UNRWA, which receives billions of dollars in funding from multiple countries, including the U.S. and the EU, acknowledged previous Israeli revelations that 12 of its workers were directly involved in the murderous rampage. The organization’scommissioner general, Philippe Lazzarini,said at the time that he had decided to \"immediately terminate the contracts of these staff members and launch an investigation in order to establish the truth without delay.\"\nA man walks in front of the UNRWA building in Gaza City on Jan. 30, 2023.(Ali Jadallah/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\nJuliette Touma, the agency’s director of communications, said in a statement to Fox News Digital that \"UNRWA encourages any entity that has any information on the very serious allegations against UNRWA staff to share it with the ongoing U.N. investigation.\"\n\"This investigation is led by the Office of Internal Oversight Services in the United Nations Headquarters in New York and is being done independently of UNRWA,\" she said.\nRuth Marks Eglash is a veteran journalist based inJerusalem, Israel.

            "content": "Ruby Chen, father of Hamas hostage Itay Chen, discusses efforts by the U.S. and Israel to free hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza.\nNew YorkGov. Kathy Hochulapologized for recent remarks in which she said Israel \"has a right to defend itself,\" while making what she later called an \"inappropriate analogy\" about Canada invading Buffalo, New York.\n\"Call out Hamas for what it is, and it is a terrorist organization that must be stopped. No one, no country should live with that threat, that specter over them,\" Hochul said Thursday during a speech at the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of New York, according to video shared on X.\"And for those that don’t understand this dynamic here in our own state, in our own country, I’ll give you an example,\" she said. \"I’m from Buffalo, anybody realize that? If Canada someday ever attacked Buffalo, I'm sorry my friends, there would be no Canada the next day. Right? I love Canada, but we did have the War of 1812, and they did burn Buffalo… so there might be a little conflict here. But think about that. That is a natural reaction. You have a right to defend yourself and to make sure it never happens again. And that is Israel’s right.\"\nHochul later walked back her comments amid online backlash, apologizing in a statement to the New York Times on Friday. The governor claimed that she made an \"inappropriate analogy\" at the Jewish philanthropic event inNew York Cityand apologized for her \"poor choice of words.\"\nSQUAD MEMBER TLAIB URGES MICHIGAN RESIDENTS TO VOTE 'UNCOMMITTED' IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY, SNUBBING BIDEN\nGov.

She apologized Friday for remarks that implied Israel has a right to destroy Gaza.(Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\"While I have been clear in my support of Israel’s right to self-defense, I have also repeatedly said and continue to believe that Palestinian civilian casualties should be avoided and that more humanitarian aid must go to the people of Gaza,\" she told the Times.\nThe apology comes after New York State AssemblymanZohran Kwame Mamdanicriticized the governor in a post on X.\n\"Governor Hochul justifying genocide, while laughing. Disgusting,\" Mamdani wrote, reacting to the clip of her speech at the annual United Jewish Appeal-Federation Lawyers Division event at the Pierre Hotel.\nGov.

Ribeiro for NY Daily News via Getty Images)\nThe UJA-Federation thanked Hochul in a post Thursday night for her attendance and \"for always standing with the Jewish community and against antisemitism and hate in New York.\"\nHochul's speech came as Israel has been ramping up strikes across Gaza in recent days. The United States, Israel's top ally, meanwhile, said it would veto another draft U.N. cease-fire resolution.\nHOUSE COMMITTEE ASKS COLUMBIA FOR RECORDS OF FOREIGN DONATIONS, DEI AND MORE IN ANTISEMITISM PROBE\nThe U.S. instead hopes to broker a cease-fire agreement and hostage release between Israel and Hamas, and envisions a wider resolution of theIsraeli-Palestinian conflict.

On the other hand, these militias were and are against Hamas and willing to fight Hamas.

            "content": "U.S. Amb. to Israel and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee assesses Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plans to take control of Gaza on ‘The Story.’\nFIRST ON FOX:AsIsraelprepares to expand its operations in the enclave, a quiet resistance is emerging against Hamas. In eastern Rafah, teachers are laying the foundation for the first schools focused on peace and tolerance under a non-Hamas civil administration.\nSamira Mousa Mohammed Abu Mousa, one of the educators, toldthe Center for Peace Communicationsin an interview, \"I despise Hamas because they were discriminatory, they were extremely biased, even when posting jobs. You had to have connections to get work.\"\nHer classroom has become a space where children are learning. During a recent lesson, she asked her students, \"Is it OK to violate a girl’s rights and lock her in her room?\" The response was immediate: \"No way!\" the kids replied. \"Everyone has the right for freedom.\" She emphasized the broader mission of education beyond academics.\nWHO IS THE GAZAN CHALLENGING HAMAS RULE, AND DOES HE HAVE A CHANCE?\nChildren back at school learning peace and tolerance in eastern Rafah. The school functions outside of the Hamas system.(The Center for Peace Communications)\n\"People like me yearn for peace, comfort, hope and safety. We want to live in an environment free of war, shelling and destruction. We have been living through war for two years. We will begin again and restore education, God willing.\"\nThe efforts in eastern Rafah mirror the broader shift across Gaza. Citizens, educators and activists are increasingly rejecting Hamas, calling for a government that serves civilians, not the terror organization.\n\"They’ve been tracking me for months,\" Moumen al-Natour, a lawyer and co-founder of the We Want to Live movement, told Fox News Digital. He has been forced to live like a fugitive due toHamas' growing crackdownon dissent..\n\"I’m moving from place to place, hiding because I don’t want to be killed or even paralyzed. This is how Hamas operates.\"\nPalestinians demonstrate in Gaza City against Hamas rule and call for an end to the war on March 26, 2025.(TPS-IL)\nAl-Natour, who is also the president of Palestinian Youth for Development, says the number of people opposing Hamas has dramatically increased since Oct. 7. \"There used to be some opposition to Hamas,\" he says, \"but after the attack and the consequences that followed, more and more people in Gaza despise them. The suffering caused by Hamas’ actions has turned the tide.\n\"It’s a catastrophic situation… almost the entire population has been displaced.\"\nEXCLUSIVE: WHISTLEBLOWER ALLEGES MISCONDUCT BY UNITED NATIONS IN GAZA\nAl-Natour says Hamas is using extreme measures to silence any opposition. \"Hamas recently released a video showing members of the Al-Qassam Brigades executing people. They publicly threatened anyone who speaks out against them, saying they would treat them as enemies.\"\nMkhaimer Abusada, a Gazan political analyst speaking from Cairo, told Fox News Digital, \"It’s very anti-Hamas in general, whether it’s in Gaza or among Palestinians here in Cairo. The Palestinian people have endured unimaginable hardship over the past 22 months – killing, destruction, starvation – with many now placing the blame squarely on Hamas. At the end of the day, they blame it on Hamas for the Oct. 7 attack.\"\nHe said the Israeli government's stance, which offers Hamas no alternative or negotiation options, has worsened the situation. \"The worst is yet to come,\" Abusada warns. \"TheIsraeli cabinet’s planto take over Gaza City and the entire Gaza Strip will only make the situation more catastrophic.\"\nPalestinian Hamas terrorists stand guard on the day of the handover of hostages in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, Feb. 22, 2025.(Reuters/Hatem Khaled/File Photo)\nNETANYAHU VOWS TO TAKE FULL CONTROL OF GAZA STRIP, ‘LIBERATE’ PEOPLE FROM HAMAS\nPalestinians, according to Abusada, are calling for Hamas to accept a ceasefire and include other parties in the negotiations. \"Negotiating solely with Hamas doesn’t help… Hamas people don't care about death. They think if they die, they go to paradise. That is why it’s very rare when Hamas fighters surrender. Most of them fight until the end, wanting to become shaheed (martyrs). They are ready to die.\"\n\"The voices I hear from Gaza are calling on Hamas to bring in the PA (Palestinian Authority) orEgyptto be part of the ceasefire talks. People just want an end to this madness,\" he said.\nAnother Gazan, who requested anonymity, echoed these sentiments. \"It’s true a lot of people are against Hamas now. People speak freely about it. They're not afraid anymore. They don’t fear Hamas anymore. They are just killers, stupid people.\"\nGaza City on Feb 2, 2025.(Ali Jadallah/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\"The people of Gaza don’t want to fight Israel,\" the Gazan man added, \"But at the same time, many Gazans do blame Israel for not differentiating between civilians and Hamas. Why are we being kept in the same area as Hamas? Israel should have thought about safe zones from the beginning. Now, more people are realizing the importance of this idea. We need many safe zones where people can go, far from Hamas, and where aid can reach them.\"\n\"For the first time,people are speaking out, even at great personal risk… they want change. They want an end to the violence, and they are ready to make their voices heard,\" al-Natour said.\nEfrat Lachter is an investigative reporter and war correspondent.

            "content": "Hamas is an armed Palestinian group and political movement in the Gaza Strip.\nOn 7 October 2023 it attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. This triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians.\nHamas, which the US, UK, Israel and many other nations have designated as a terrorist organisation, has been severely weakened during the conflict.\nIn October 2025, the first phase of a ceasefire deal brokered by US President Donald Trump saw the remaining 20 living Israeli hostages released and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees freed from Israeli jails.\nHamas started as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood in 1987. Its name means Islamic Resistance Movement.\nIt is opposed to the existence of Israel on what it says is Palestinian land. It wants a state based on Islam in its place and across the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.\nIt has, however, signalled its willingness to accept an interim Palestinian state in just the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, without renouncing its claim to all of historic Palestine.\nBefore the 7 October attacks, Hamas was estimated to have about 30,000 fighters, but Israel said in August 2024 that its forces had killed more than 17,000 of them. This could not be independently verified.\nHamas became the sole ruler in the Gaza Strip in 2007, after winning Palestinian elections and violently ousting rivals.\nHowever, as a result of the war, the group's infrastructure and ability to operate openly have been all but destroyed.\nWhen Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, the group's main leader was Ismail Haniyeh. He was based in Qatar, where the group has its political headquarters.\nHaniyeh was assassinated while visiting the Iranian capital, Tehran, in July 2024,in an attack which Israel said it carried out.\nHe was replaced by Yahya Sinwar, who had been leader of Hamas in Gaza since 2017.\nSinwar was killed by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers in Gaza in October 2024.\nHe was the architect of the 7 October attacks and was Israel's most wanted man.\nSeveral other top commanders of Hamas have been killed by Israel since the war began.\nSince Sinwar's death, Hamas has been led by a five-man council. At its head is believed to beKhalil al-Hayya, Sinwar's former deputy. Al-Hayya has been based in Qatar since before the October 2023 attack and has led Hamas delegations in indirect ceasefire talks with Israel.\nThe council also includes Khaled Meshaal, the head of Hamas's relations with Palestinian communities abroad; Zaher Jabarin, the exiled West Bank leader; Muhammad Darwish, head of the Shura Council, Hamas's top decision-making body; and a fifth individual whose identity is unknown. All are based in Qatar or Turkey.\nIn September 2025, Israel carried out strikes targeting Hamas leaders including Al-Hayya in Qatar, ina move which received international condemnation. Five Hamas members and a Qatari security official were killed, but Hamas said its leaders survived.\nHamas's most important ally is Iran - its biggest backer in terms of funds, weapons and political support.\nHamas led the deadliest attack on Israel in its history, killing about 1,200 people, including more than 360 young people at a music festival.\nThe unprecedented attack sent shockwaves across the country, as Hamas gunmen targeted border communities for hours and took hostages.\nHamas has described the attack as a response to what it says are decades of Israeli oppression, the killings of Palestinians and years-long blockade of the Gaza Strip.\nAs Israel prepared to mark a year since the attack, al-Hayya justified it by saying it had put the plight of the Palestinians on the world's political agenda.\n\"It was necessary to raise an alarm in the world to tell them that here there is a people who have a cause and have demands that must be met,\" he told the BBC's Jeremy Bowen.\nHamas has also said the attack was a reaction to what it claims are Israeli efforts to take over the al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem - Islam's third holiest site. Hamas also wants the release of thousands of Palestinians in Israeli prisons.\nThe year leading up to the attack was also the deadliest in the occupation of the West Bank, since the UN began recording data in 2005. By the end of the year at least 505 Palestinians had been killed there, mostly by Israeli soldiers and settlers. In the same year, 30 Israelis were also killed in the West Bank.\nAll Palestinian factions and parties oppose Israel's presence in the West Bank, as well as occupied East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. They want the land to be part of a future independent state, something backed by the vast majority of the international community.\nIsrael's occupation of the land and settlements it has built there isillegal under international law. However, Israel's current government does not recognise the right of the Palestinians to have their own state, arguing that it would be a security threat. It also claims a historical right to the West Bank.\nAnalysts have suggested the attack could also have been timed to derail recognition of Israel by Saudi Arabia, which was considered likely at the time.\nIsrael launched a massive military offensive against Hamas in Gaza following the 7 October attack. It began with air strikes and was followed by a ground invasion.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's aims included destroying Hamas, returning the hostages and making sure Israel cannot be threatened in future.\nMore than 67,000 people in Gaza - mostly civilians, about half of whom were women and children - have been killed in the fighting, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nSome 460 Israeli soldiers have been killed during the war, the Israeli military says.\nThe UN says most of the 2.3 million population of Gaza have been forced from their homes and that Gaza's buildings and infrastructure have suffered catastrophic damage.\nHundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced to flee when Israel began a major offensive to fully occupy Gaza City which, it says, remains Hamas's \"main stronghold\". The offensive marked a major escalation in Israel's two-year military campaign.\nA United Nations (UN) commission of inquiry said that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza. The UN's top court – the International Court of Justice - is currently examining aclaim of genocide in a case brought by South Africa. Israel says the case is \"wholly unfounded\".\nUN-backed experts also say there is famine in Gaza City and surrounding areas, conditions which it says are \"entirely man-made\". Israel called the experts' declaration an \"outright lie\".\nBoth Israel and Hamas have been accused of committing war crimes and human rights abuses. TheUN Human Rights Council says both sides have mounted attacksagainst civilian populations and are responsible for \"murder or wilful killings\". Both have rejected the report's findings.\nIn September 2025, the UK formally recognised a Palestinian state,citing the \"appalling situation\" in Gazaand Israel's illegal settlement expansion in the West Bank. Several other countries, including France, Canada and Australia also extended recognition. Israel condemned the moves, saying they rewarded Hamas for the 7 October attack.\nIn October 2025, the Israeli government and Hamas agreed to the first phase ofUS President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan, leading to a ceasefire in Gaza.\nIsrael pulled its troops back to an agreed position, and allowed more aid to enter the Strip. Hamas returned the remaining 20 living Israeli hostages, while Israel freed almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.\nNegotiations continue over the details of the later phases of the peace deal.\nSince its founding, Hamas has carried out bombings, rocket attacks and shootings, killing civilians and soldiers in Israel.\nIsrael has carried out operations against Hamas in Gaza and its cells in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, killing its fighters. In such operations, Israel has killed many Palestinian civilians.\nThe two sides have also fought several major conflicts - in 2008-09, 2012 and 2014.\nThe last major conflict between the two sides was in May 2021, which ended in a ceasefire after 11 days.\nEvery round of fighting has seen people killed on both sides, the vast majority of them Palestinians in Gaza.\nThe Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.\nIt was part of a proposed Arab state under the original UN partition plan in 1947. Gaza was then occupied by Egypt in the war that followed Israel's creation, then captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War.\nIsrael withdrew its troops and about 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005, though the UN still considers the land to be occupied.\nGaza is one of the world's most densely populated places.\nJust over three-quarters of its population are registered refugees, or descendants of refugees, the UN says.\nEven before the latest war between Israel and Hamas, the territory had one of the highest unemployment rates in the world, with most of its population living below the poverty line and depending on food aid to survive.\nIsrael controls Gaza's airspace, its shoreline and the shared border, as well as the movement of people and goods.",

            "content": "Five armed Palestinian groups joined Hamas in the deadly 7 October attack on Israel after training together in military-style exercises from 2020 onwards, BBC News analysis shows.\nThe groups carried out joint drills in Gaza which closely resembled the tactics used during the deadly assault - including at a site less than 1km (0.6 miles) from the barrier with Israel - and posted them on social media.\nThey practised hostage-taking, raiding compounds and breaching Israel's defences during these exercises, the last of which was held just 25 days before the attack.\nBBC Arabic and BBC Verify have collated evidence which shows how Hamas brought together Gaza's factions to hone their combat methods - and ultimately execute a raid into Israel which has plunged the region into war.\nOn 29 December 2020, Hamas's overall leader Ismail Haniyeh declared the first of four drills codenamed Strong Pillar a \"strong message and a sign of unity\" between Gaza's various armed factions.\nAs the most powerful of Gaza's armed groups, Hamas was the dominant force in a coalition which brought together 10 other Palestinian factions in a war games-style exercise overseen by a \"joint operation room\".\nThe structure was set up in 2018 to coordinate Gaza's armed factions under a central command.\nPrior to 2018, Hamas had formally coordinated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Gaza's second largest armed faction and - like Hamas - a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK and other countries.\nHamas had also fought alongside other groups in previous conflicts, but the 2020 drill was billed in propaganda as evidence a wider array of groups were being unified.\nHamas's leader said the first drill reflected the \"permanent readiness\" of the armed factions.\nThe 2020 exercise was the first of four joint drills held over three years, each of which was documented in polished videos posted on public social media channels.\nThe BBC has visually identified 10 groups, including PIJ, by their distinctive headbands and emblems training alongside Hamas during the Strong Pillar drills in footage posted on the messaging app Telegram.\nFollowing the 7 October attack, five of the groups went on to post videos claiming to show them taking part in the assault. Three others issued written statements on Telegram claiming to have participated.\nThe role of these groups has come into sharp focus as pressure builds on Hamas to find dozens of women and children believed to have been taken as captives from Israel into Gaza by other factions on 7 October.\nThree groups - PIJ, the Mujahideen Brigades and Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades - claim to have seized Israeli hostages, alongside Hamas, on that day.\nEfforts to extend the temporary truce in Gaza were said to be hinging on Hamas locating those hostages.\nWhile these groups are drawn from a broad ideological spectrum ranging from hard-line Islamist to relatively secular, all shared a willingness to use violence against Israel.\nHamas statements repeatedly stressed the theme of unity between Gaza's disparate armed groups. The group suggested they were equal partners in the joint drills, whilst it continued to play a leading role in the plans to attack Israel.\nFootage from the first drill shows masked commanders in a bunker appearing to conduct the exercise, and begins with a volley of rocket fire.\nIt cuts to heavily armed fighters overrunning a mocked-up tank marked with an Israeli flag, detaining a crew member and dragging him away as a prisoner, as well as raiding buildings.\nWe know from videos and harrowing witness statements that both tactics were used to capture soldiers and target civilians on 7 October, when around 1,200 people were killed and an estimated 240 hostages were taken.\nThe second Strong Pillar drill was held almost exactly one year later.\nAyman Nofal, a commander in the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - the official name for Hamas's armed wing - said the aim of the exercise on 26 December 2021 was to \"affirm the unity of the resistance factions\".\nHe said the drills would \"tell the enemy that the walls and engineering measures on the borders of Gaza will not protect them\".\nAnother Hamas statement said the \"joint military manoeuvres\" were designed to \"simulate the liberation of settlements near Gaza\" - which is how the group refers to Israeli communities.\nThe exercise was repeated on 28 December 2022, and propaganda images of fighters practising clearing buildings and overrunning tanks in what appears to be a replica of a military base were published to mark the event.\nThe exercises were reported on in Israel, so it's inconceivable they were not being closely monitored by the country's extensive intelligence agencies.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have previously carried out air strikes to disrupt Hamas's training activities. In April 2023, they bombed the site used for the first Strong Pillar drill.\nWeeks before the attacks, female surveillance soldiers near the Gaza border reportedly warned of unusually high drone activity and that Hamas was training to take over observation posts with replicas of their positions.\nBut,according to reports in the Israeli media, they say they were ignored.\nBrigadier General Amir Avivi, a former IDF deputy commander in Gaza, told the BBC:  \"There was a lot of intelligence that they were doing this training - after all, the videos are public, and this was happening just hundreds of metres from the fence (with Israel).\"\nBut he said while the military knew about the drills, they \"didn't see what they were training for\".\nThe IDF said they \"eliminated\" Nofal on 17 October 2023, the first senior Hamas military leader to be killed during the conflict.\nHamas went to great lengths to make sure the drills were realistic.\nIn 2022, fighters practised storming a mock Israeli military base built just 2.6km (1.6 miles) from the Erez crossing, a route between Gaza and Israel controlled by the IDF.\nBBC Verify has pinpointed the site in the far north of Gaza, just 800m (0.5 miles) from the barrier, by matching geographic features seen in the training footage to aerial images of the area. As of November 2023, the site was still visible on Bing Maps.\nThe training camp was within 1.6km (1 mile) of an Israeli observation tower and an elevated observation box, elements in a security barrier Israel has spent hundreds of millions of dollars constructing.\nThe mock base is on land dug several metres below ground level, so it may not have been immediately visible to any nearby Israeli patrols - but the smoke rising from the explosions surely would have been, and the IDF is known to use aerial surveillance.\nHamas used this site to practise storming buildings, taking hostages at gunpoint and destroying security barriers.\nBBC Verify has used publicly available information - including satellite imagery - to locate 14 training sites at nine different locations across Gaza.\nThey even trained twice at a site less than 1.6 km (1 mile) from the United Nations' aid agency distribution centre, and which was visible in the background of an official video published by the agency in December 2022.\nOn 10 September 2023, the so-called joint committee room published images on its dedicated Telegram channel of men in military uniforms carrying out surveillance of military installations along the Gaza barrier.\nTwo days later, the fourth Strong Pillar military exercise was staged, and by 7 October, all the tactics that would be deployed in the unprecedented attack had been rehearsed.\nFighters were filmed riding in the same type of white Toyota pickup trucks which were seen roaming through southern Israel the following month.\nThe propaganda video shows gunmen raiding mock buildings and firing at dummy targets inside, as well as training to storm a beach using a boat and underwater divers. Israel has said it repelled attempted Hamas boat landings on its shores on 7 October.\nHowever, Hamas did not publicise its training with motorcycles and paragliders as part of the Strong Pillar propaganda.\nA training video posted by Hamas three days after 7 October shows fences and barriers being demolished to allow motorcycles to pass through, a tactic they used to reach communities in southern Israel. We have not identified similar earlier videos.\nFootage of fighters using paragliding equipment was also not published until the 7 October attack was under way.\nIn a training video shared on the day of the attack, gunmen are seen landing in a mock kibbutz at an airstrip we have located to a site north of Rafah in southern Gaza.\nBBC Verify established it was recorded some time before 25 August 2022, and was stored in a computer file titled Eagle Squadron, the name Hamas uses for its aerial division - suggesting the paragliders plan was in the works for over a year.\nBefore 7 October, Hamas was thought to have about 30,000 fighters in the Gaza Strip, according to reports quoting IDF commanders. It was also thought that Hamas could draw on several thousands of fighters from smaller groups.\nHamas is by far the most powerful of the Palestinian armed groups, even without the support of other factions - suggesting its interest in galvanising the factions was driven by an attempt to secure broad support within Gaza at least as much as bolstering its own numbers.\nThe IDF has previously estimated 1,500 fighters joined the 7 October raids. TheTimes of Israelreported earlier this month the IDF now believes the number was closer to 3,000.\nWhatever the true number, it means only a relatively small fraction of the total number of armed operatives in Gaza took part. It is not possible to verify precise numbers for how many fighters from smaller groups took part in the attack or the Strong Pillar drills.\nWhile Hamas was building cross-faction support in the build-up to the attack, Hisham Jaber, a former Brigadier General in the Lebanese army who is now a security analyst at the Middle East Centre for Studies and Research, said he believed only Hamas was aware of the ultimate plan, and it was \"probable [they] asked other factions to join on the day\".\nAndreas Krieg, a senior lecturer in security studies at Kings College London, told the BBC: \"While there was centralised planning, execution was de-centralised, with each squad operationalising the plan as they saw fit.\"\nHe said people inside Hamas were said to be surprised by the weakness of Israel's defences, and assessed militants had likely bypassed Israel's surveillance technology by communicating offline.\nHugh Lovatt, a Middle East analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Israel would have been aware of the joint training drills but \"reached the wrong conclusion\", assessing they amounted to the \"standard\" activity of paramilitary groups in the Palestinian territories, rather than being \"indicative of a looming large-scale attack\".\nAsked about the issues raised in this article, the Israel Defense Forces said it was \"currently focused on eliminating the threat from the terrorist organisation Hamas\" and questions about any potential failures \"will be looked into in a later stage\".\nIt could be several years until Israel formally reckons with whether it missed opportunities to prevent the 7 October massacre.\nThe ramifications for its military, intelligence services and government could be seismic.\nAdditional reporting by Paul Brown, Kumar Malhotra and Abdirahim Saeed.

            "content": "Israel has completed forensic tests confirming the identities of four dead Israeli hostages whose bodies were handed over by Hamas in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners.\nOn Wednesday night, Hamas passed four coffins to the Red Cross from Gaza. Israel's prime minister confirmed on Thursday that they contained the remains of Shlomo Mansour, 86, Ohad Yahalomi, 50, Tsachi Idan, 50, and Itzik Elgarat, 69, and said all four men had been murdered.\nThe handover cleared the way for the delayed release of more than 600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.\nIt was the last exchange of the six-week-long first phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal, leaving questions over what happens next.\nHamas has said it is ready to start delayed indirect negotiations on the second phase, which aims to end the war and secure the release of the remaining Israeli hostages.\nThe office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - who faces pressures from his political allies to resume fighting and crush Hamas - said he had instructed negotiators to depart for Cairo on Thursday for talks.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Palestinian armed group in response to its unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.\nAt least 48,365 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nMost of Gaza's population of 2.1 million has been displaced multiple times. Almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed. The healthcare, water, sanitation, and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are severe shortages of food, fuel, medicine, and shelter.\nHamas handed over the four men's bodies late on Wednesday night, with no public ceremony, unlike in previous exchanges during the current ceasefire.\nIsraeli authorities carried out initial forensic testing close to the Israel-Gaza border before transferring the remains to the Abu Kabir Institute of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv.\nIt came after the body of a Palestinian woman from Gaza was handed over by Hamas to Israel instead of the body of hostage Shiri Bibas last week, prompting fury in Israel. Hamas said it was a mistake and transferred Bibas's body the following day.\nFollowing the identification of the bodies received overnight, the Israeli prime minister's office announced that military officials had informed the Mansour, Yahalomi, Idan and Elgarat families that their loved ones \"were murdered and have been returned for burial in Israel\".\n\"Pursuant to the intelligence and all of the information at our disposal, Ohad Yahalomi, Tsachi Idan and Itzik Elgarat were murdered while held hostage in Gaza,\" it added.\n\"Shlomo Mansour was murdered in the 7 October 2023 massacre and his body had been held in the Gaza Strip.\"\nThere was no immediate response to the allegations from Hamas.\nTsachi Idan was taken by Hamas gunmen from his home in Nahal Oz, a kibbutz near the Gaza border on 7 October 2023. His eldest child, Maayan - who had just turned 18 - was shot and killed in front of her siblings and parents.\nHis family said that \"the unbearable journey to bring back our beloved and dear Tsachi from the inferno in Gaza has ended with the identification of his body\".\nItzik Elgarat was kidnapped from Nir Oz, another kibbutz, and reportedly shot in the hand during the attack.\nOhad Yahalomi, a French-Israeli dual national, was abducted from Nir Oz, along with his 12-year-old son, Eitan, who was released during a week-long ceasefire in November 2023.\nIraq-born Shlomo Mansour was killed by Hamas at Kibbutz Kissufim on 7 October 2023 and his body was taken to Gaza as a hostage.\nHis sister, Hadassah Lazar, told Israel's Channel 12 that \"we've reached an absurd situation where we take comfort in receiving a body to bury\". But, she added: \"The circle is not yet closed. We will continue fighting until the last hostage returns home.\"\nPresident Isaac Herzog said: \"Together with the entire nation, we share in the immense grief and sorrow of the bereaved families and [their] communities.\n\"The return of our brothers' bodies from captivity underscores our moral obligation to do everything in our power to bring back all the hostages - the living to their loving families, and the fallen to be late to rest.\"\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the hostages' families, insisted that Ohad Yahalomi, Tsachi Idan and Itzik Elgarat could have returned alive if the Israeli government had agreed to the ceasefire deal sooner.\n\"[They] endured a prolonged period in Hamas captivity in Gaza. They should have returned alive; they could have been saved and brought back through an agreement.\"\nIt urged Israel's leaders to ensure the return of the 59 hostages remaining in captivity - 35 of whom are presumed dead - by the start of next week, warning that they \"have no time left\".\nNetanyahu promised Israeli authorities would \"act relentlessly until we bring everyone back\".\nFollowing the handover of the hostages' bodies, buses carrying Palestinian prisoners were seen leaving Ofer prison in the north of the occupied West Bank and then arriving in Ramallah, where a large crowd gathered to celebrate their release.\n\"We have been taken out of suffering as if we have been dug out from our own graves. No prisoner has had the experience of having their own release delayed twice,\" one of the prisoners, Yahya Shrida, told reporters.\n\"What we have been through is a situation that the mountains can't carry. It is very hard to explain.\"\nLater, dozens more Palestinians were seen getting off buses outside the European Gaza hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza.\nMany of them said they had endured harsh conditions while in detention.\n\"During the first period in jail, we were handcuffed and blindfolded for 90 days, you see no-one and no-one sees us. And we used to sit on our knees or on our buttocks for 18 or 20 hours,\" Eyad al-Saudi said.\nHe added: \"We left behind young detainees, and our joy will not be complete until the remaining detained prisoners are released from prison.\"\nThe Israeli military and prison service have previously said that detainees and prisoners are treated in accordance with the law.\nThe Palestinian Prisoners Media Office said a total of 642 Palestinians in Israeli jails were supposed to be released in the exchange.\nAmong them were 445 Gazans who were detained by Israeli forces without charge during the war and 46 women and children, it said. The 151 prisoners include dozens convicted of carrying out deadly attacks on Israelis who are being sent abroad.\nIsrael had delayed the releases since last Saturday in protest at what it said were \"Hamas's repeated violations, including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes\".\nHamas said Israel's decision was a \"blatant\" violation and said indirect talks about further steps in the ceasefire deal were conditional on the prisoners being released.\nAfter days of impasse, Egyptian mediators secured the new exchange, with the Israeli prime minister's office saying the hostages' bodies would be handed over \"in an agreed-upon procedure and without Hamas ceremonies\".\nA Hamas official meanwhile said the handover would take place \"without public presence to prevent the occupation from finding any pretext for delay or obstruction\".\nIt remains unclear whether the truce will be extended or progress to a planned second phase, which would see the release of all remaining living hostages in Gaza in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners.\nIndirect negotiations for the second phase were due to start earlier this month but they have not yet got under way.\nHamas affirmed the group's \"full commitment to the ceasefire agreement\" on Thursday and its \"readiness to enter into negotiations for the second phase\".\nLater, the Israeli prime minister's office said he had \"instructed the negotiation delegation to depart for Cairo today to continue the talks\", without giving any details.\n\"Our delegation will go to Cairo and see whether we have a common ground to negotiate,\" Foreign Minister Gideon Saar told reporters.\n\"We said we are ready to make the framework longer in return to release more hostages. If it is possible we'll do that.\"",

            "content": "Israel said it killed a senior Hamas commander on Saturday in a strike on a vehicle inside Gaza.\nIn a joint statement, the Israeli military and security agency Shin Bet announced it had \"eliminated\" Raed Saad, the head of weapons production for Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades, in Gaza city.\nSaad had been regarded as one of the most prominent Qassam commanders and led several brigades during Hamas's 7 October attacks on Israeli communities east of Gaza City.\nThe Hamas-run Civil Defence spokesman, Mahmoud Basal, told the BBC that four people were killed in the strike. He said multiple passers-by were also injured by the blast.\nA local Hamas official in Gaza told the BBC that the strike also killed Saad's aide and another lower-ranking official identified as Abu Imad al-Laban.\nThe BBC is prevented by Israel from reporting independently from inside Gaza and is unable to verify details of the incident.\nThe IDF and ISA joint statement added that Saad had been \"responsible for the deaths of many soldiers\" killed in the Gaza Strip as the result of explosive devices.\nSaad is believed to be a member of the newly formed five-member leadership military council established since a ceasefire took hold in October.\nIsrael has attempted to kill him on multiple occasions.\nOne of the most notable attempts was during a surprise Israeli operation in Gaza City in March 2024, when Israeli forces reportedly sought to arrest or kill him. Sources at the time said Saad had been inside the targeted complex but managed to escape moments before the raid.\nHe has long been considered one of Israel's most wanted Hamas figures, with Israeli attempts to kill him spanning more than two decades.\nSaturday's attack happened on the Palestinian-controlled side of the so-called Yellow Line which has divided Gaza since an unstable US-led ceasefire came into effect on 10 October.\nIsraeli forces control the area to the east of the line, which includes just over half of the Gaza Strip.\nThe first phase of US president Donald Trump's 20-point plan for peace in the region required the return of all 20 living and 28 dead hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023.\nAbout 1,200 people were killed in the attack and more than 250 people were taken hostage.\nAll have been returned except for the remains of an Israeli police officer, Ran Gvili, 24, who is believed to have been killed while fighting Hamas gunmen in Kibbutz Alumim.\nSince then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action.\nThe diplomatic focus is now shifting to the next stage of President Trump's plan which would require the disarmament of Hamas as part of what it calls the de-radicalisation and redevelopment of Gaza.\nIt envisages Gaza being run by the \"temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee,\" overseen by a \"Board of Peace\" chaired by Trump.\nSecurity would be provided by an International Stabilisation Force although its make up remains unclear.\nThe eventual aim is for a reformed Palestinian Authority to take control of the territory, and for Israeli forces to withdraw, after which \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood\".\nMany aspects of the plan are controversial in Israel where prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state.\nTrump is due to meet Netanyahu to discuss the plan in the US on 29 December.",

            "content": "Israel has confirmed that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) handed over the body of deceased Israeli hostage Dror Or on Tuesday.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said his government \"shares in the deep sorrow of the Or family\" following the completion of forensic testing overnight.\nIt stressed that Israeli authorities were working \"tirelessly\" to bring home the last two dead hostages still in Gaza and demanded that Hamas uphold its commitments to hand over their remains under the six-week-old Gaza ceasefire agreement.\nOr's body was transferred via the Red Cross after PIJ and Hamas announced that it had been recovered in central Gaza on Monday.\nOn Wednesday morning, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its representatives had informed Or's family that his body was returned after experts at the National Centre of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv confirmed its identity.\nAccording to the IDF, the 48-year-old father of three was killed by PIJ at his home in Kibbutz Be'eri during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023. His body was then abducted and taken to Gaza as a hostage.\nMr Or's wife, Yonat, was also killed during the attack, while two of their children, Noam and Alma, were kidnapped alive. They were held hostage in Gaza until November 2023, when they were released as part of a week-long ceasefire deal.\n\"The IDF expresses deep condolences to the families, continues to make every effort to return all the deceased hostages, and is prepared for the continued implementation of the agreement,\" an IDF statement said.\n\"Hamas is required to fulfil its part of the agreement and make the necessary efforts to return all the hostages to their families and to a dignified burial.\"\nUnder the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.\nAll the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.\nSo far, the remains of 23 dead Israeli hostages have been handed over, along with those of three foreign hostages – one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.\nIn exchange, Israel has handed over the bodies of 330 Palestinians killed during the war. It should hand over another 15 bodies in return for Mr Or's remains.\nOne of the remaining dead hostages is Israeli - Ran Gvili, 24 - and the other is Thai - Suthisak Rintalak, 43.\nIsrael has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the hostages' bodies, while Hamas has insisted it is struggling to find them under rubble.\nThe slow progress has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan. This includes plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction.\nThe two dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted by Hamas and its allies on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed.\nIsrael responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 69,770 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

            "content": "Ten people, including six children, have been killed in an Israeli air strike while waiting to fill water containers in central Gaza on Sunday, emergency service officials say.\nTheir bodies were sent to Nuseirat's al-Awda Hospital, which also treated 16 injured people including seven children, a doctor there said.\nEyewitnesses said adrone fired a missile at a crowd queuing with empty jerry cans next to a water tanker in al-Nuseirat refugee camp.\nThe Israeli military said there had been a \"technical error\" with a strike targeting an Islamic Jihad \"terrorist\" that caused the munition to fall dozens of metres from the target. The incident is under review, the military added.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was aware of the \"claim regarding casualties in the area as a result\", adding that it works to mitigate civilian harm \"as much as possible\" and \"regrets any harm to uninvolved civilians\".\nVerified video of the aftermath shows dozens of people rushing to help injured people, including children, lying among yellow jerry cans.\nBBC Verify was able to pinpoint the location by matching it with the position of nearby rooftops, trees and telegraph poles.\nIt was filmed early morning local time, going by shadows, on a road about 80m (262ft) south-west of the Nuseirat Junior High School. The site itself is two buildings along from another building listed online as a kindergarten.\nSatellite imagery from three weeks ago shows a tanker truck parked across the street.\nFrom the video, it cannot be determined what struck the site and, if it was a malfunctioning Israeli munition, from which direction it had been fired.\nThe strike came as Israeli aerial attacks across the Gaza Strip have escalated.\nA spokesperson for Gaza's Civil Defence Agency said 19 other Palestinians had been killed on Sunday, in three separate strikes on residential buildings in central Gaza and Gaza City.\nSeparately, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it had treated more mass casualty cases at its Rafah field hospital in southern Gaza in the last six weeks than in the 12 months before that.\nIt said that its field hospital in Rafah had received 132 patients \"suffering from weapon-related injuries\" on Saturday, 31 of whom died.\nThe \"overwhelming majority\" of the patients had gunshot wounds, it added, and \"all responsive individuals\" reported they had been trying to access food distribution sites.\nIt said that the hospital had treated more than 3,400 weapon-wounded patients and recorded more than 250 deaths since new food distribution sites opened on 27 May - exceeding \"all mass casualty cases treated at the hospital\" in the year prior.\n\"The alarming frequency and scale of these mass casualty incidents underscore the horrific conditions civilians in Gaza are enduring,\" the ICRC said.\nOn Saturday, southern Gaza's Nasser hospitalsaid 24 people were killed near an aid distribution site, where witnesses said Israeli troops had opened fire as people were trying to access food.\nThe Israeli military said there were \"no known injured individuals\" from IDF fire near the site. Separately, a military official said warning shots were fired to disperse people who the IDF believed were a threat.\nThe UN human rights office said on Friday that it had so far recorded 789 aid-related killings.\nIt said that of those, 615 were in the vicinity of the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF)'s sites, which opened on 27 May and are operated by US private security contractors inside military zones in southern and central Gaza.\nThe other 183 killings were recorded near UN and other aid convoys.\nThe Israeli military said it recognised there had been incidents in which civilians had been harmed and that it was working to minimise \"possible friction between the population and the [Israeli] forces as much as possible\".\nThe GHF accused the UN of using \"false and misleading\" statistics from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.\nGHF boss Johnnie Moorepreviously told the BBChe was not denying deaths near aid sites, but said \"100% of those casualties are being attributed to close proximity to GHF\" and that was \"not true\".\nIsrael does not allow international news organisations, including the BBC, into Gaza.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 57,882 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nMost of Gaza's population has been displaced multiple times.\nMore than 90% of homes are estimated to be damaged or destroyed. The healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.\nThis week, for the first time in 130 days, 75,000 litres of fuel was allowed into Gaza - \"far from enough to meet the daily needs of the population and vital civilian aid operations\", the United Nations said.\nNine UN agencies warned on Saturday that Gaza's fuel shortage had reached \"critical levels\", and if fuel ran out, it would affect hospitals, water systems, sanitation networks and bakeries.\n\"Hospitals are already going dark, maternity, neonatal and intensive care units are failing, and ambulances can no longer move,\" the UN said.\nAdditional reporting by Richard Irvine-Brown and Benedict Garman, BBC Verify",

            "content": "\"My heart and soul died when Rifaat was killed,\" says Hajjah Umm Mohammed, the mother of a Palestinian paramedic who was one of 15 emergency workers killed by Israeli troops in southern Gaza last month.\nRifaat Radwan, 23, was travelling in a Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) ambulance in a convoy of emergency vehicles when it came under fire on the outskirts of Rafah on 23 March.\n\"I never expected him to be killed, especially since the area was classified as 'green', meaning safe and open to ambulances,\" she adds.\nThe Israeli military initially claimed the troops opened fire because the convoy approached them \"suspiciously\" in darkness without headlights or flashing emergency lights.\nHowever,video filmed by Rifaat and found on his phone after his body was recovered, showed the vehicles' lights were on as they answered a call to help wounded people.\n\"Forgive me, mother... this is the path I chose to help people,\" Rifaat can be heard saying in the video shortly before he was killed, amid the sound of heavy gunfire.\nUmm Mohammed believes he was asking for her forgiveness because he knew she would never see him again.\n\"I entrusted Rifaat to God every time he went out to work,\" she says. \"He was brave, travelling across Gaza from north to south.\"\nRifaat began volunteering with the PRCS after Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza following Hamas's unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023.\nUmm Mohammed says her son enjoyed humanitarian work.\n\"He even transported the wounded to cross into Egypt for treatment through the Rafah crossing.\"\nUmm Mohammed explains that on the day he died, Rifaat had gone out with an ambulance after reports of several killed in an Israeli air strike.\n\"I didn't know he would be one of them [too],\" she says.\nIt was a week before his body and those of his colleagues were found buried in a shallow grave on 30 March.\n\"Instead of celebrating Eid al-Fitr with Rifaat, we went with the Red Cross to collect his body from Nasser hospital in Khan Younis to bury him,\" she recalls.\n\"It was badly decomposed and they wouldn't allow me to see it.\"\nUmm Mohammed says he was an \"absolutely beautiful\" human being and the sole supporter of her and his father after all his siblings got married.\nFollowing the discovery of the video footage, an Israeli military official changed its initial account that claimed the vehicles approached without their lights on. The official said the person who gave the account was \"mistaken\".\nThe official also said the troops perceived the emergency workers as a threat because of an earlier encounter in the area, and that at least six of those killed were Hamas operatives, without providing any evidence.\nThe troops buried the bodies, including Rifaat's, in sand to protect them from wild animals, the official said.\nThey were not uncovered until a week after the incident because international agencies, including the UN, could not organise safe passage to the area or locate the spot.\nWhen the UN-led team found the bodies they also discovered Rifaat's mobile phone containing footage of the incident.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has promised a \"thorough examination\" of the incident, saying it would \"understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation\".\nThe PRCS has alleged that the emergency workers were targeted in a \"series of deliberate attacks\" which constituted a \"full-fledged war crime\", and demanded an independent international investigation.\n\"We need justice for the victims. We need to ensure that all of those who are responsible are held to account. Without this, the crimes will continue to happen,\" PRCS spokeswoman Nebal Farsakh said on Wednesday.\n\"I have already lost 27 PRCS colleagues. All of them were killed while doing their humanitarian work. All of them were killed while wearing the Red Crescent emblem. This is not acceptable. It should never, ever have happened. We are not targets. And international humanitarian law is clear – humanitarians, medical personnel should be respected and protected.\"\nMunther Abed, a paramedic who survived the incident, says he and his colleagues were fired at without warning.\n\"I dropped to the floor in the back of the vehicle and didn't hear any sound from my colleagues except their death gasps,\"he told the BBC last week.\n\"Then, Israeli special forces arrested me, pinning my head to the ground so I couldn't see what happened to my team.\"\nHolding back tears, Munther added: \"When I found out they were all martyred, it crushed me. They were my second family... my brothers, my friends, my loved ones.\n\"I wished I had died from the horror of what I saw.\"\nHe says his phone was confiscated when he was detained.\n\"They interrogated me for 15 hours with beatings, insults, and both physical and verbal torture,\" he adds.\nThe BBC has put his claims to the IDF, but it is yet to respond.\nThe PRCS said the area the emergency workers were in had not been classified by the Israeli military as a \"red zone\", which meant no prior co-ordination was required to access the site, and that the video showed that Israeli military vehicles had not been visible in the area.\nIt said preliminary forensic reports showed that the paramedics were killed by \"multiple gunshot wounds to the upper parts of the bodies\", which it described as \"further evidence of deliberate killing\".\nIt also dismissed the IDF's internal inquiry and rejected the IDF's accusation that Hamas operatives were among those killed.\nThe IDF said in a statement on Monday that its Chief of Staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, had been presented with the findings of the initial inquiry into the incident and instructed that it be \"pursued in greater depth and completed in the coming days by the general staff investigation mechanism\".\n\"All the claims raised regarding the incident will be examined through the mechanism and presented in a detailed and thorough manner for a decision on how to handle the event,\" it added.\nAbout 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage in the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.\nMore than 50,750 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nA ceasefire deal announced in January collapsed in March and there are currently 59 hostages still held in Gaza, 24 of whom are believed to be still alive.",

            "content": "Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and injury\nThere is no conscience. There is no humanity. There are only leaders who watch and do not act.\nThis is what Ahmed al-Dalou believes, as the images of his family burning replay in his mind. He says his life is gone. It died in the inferno of al-Aqsa compound with his boys and wife in the early hours of Monday 14 October.\nIn front of him on the ground is a shroud, wrapped around the body of Abdulrahman,12, his youngest son.\nThe child lingered in agony for four days after the fire, sparked by an Israeli strike. The day before he died Ahmed saw him in hospital and he was able to tell his father: “Don’t be worried, I am OK dad… I’m fine. Don’t be afraid.”\nAhmed is half speaking, half crying, as he talks of what has been taken from him.\n“Three times I tried to pull him [Abdulrahman] out of the fire, but his body fell back into it.”\nHis older brother, Sha'aban, 19, and his mother, Alaa, 37, both died on the night of the fire.\nSha'aban became a new symbol of Gaza’s terrible suffering. Images of him writhing in agony as he burned to death in the family’s tent were shared around the world on social media.\nThere are burns all over Ahmed’s face and hands. The tone of his voice is high, a keening sound. Of the anonymous pilot who sent the missile, and the leaders who gave him orders, Ahmed said: “They broke my heart, and they broke my spirit… I wish the fire had burned me.”\nThe strike happened at about 01:15 local time last Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday).\nThe Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas \"command and control\" centre in the al-Aqsa hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip.\nFour people were killed immediately and dozens more wounded, including many with severe burn injuries. The Israel Defense Forces said it was “reviewing the incident”.\nA spokesperson for the White House told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that footage of the fire was “deeply disturbing” and called on Israel to do more to protect civilians.\n“Israel has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties - and what happened here is horrifying - even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.”\nThe US and other powers, including Britain, have expressed concern about civilian casualties since the early stages of the war.\nPeople are burned to death, blown to pieces, and shot every day in this war.\nMost of the time the death agonies happen away from the cameras. It is the frantic search for survivors in the rubble, the dramatic scenes at hospitals, the endless stream of funerals, that are captured by cameras.\nBut the death of Sha'aban al-Dalou was different. His hand can be seen, reaching out of the inferno, a figure wrapped in flame, writhing and beyond the reach of any help.\nIn the days following his death Sha'aban’s own videos and photographs emerged. He was a typical teenager of his generation, aware of the power of social media, adept at recording his daily life.\nThe burning figure from the night of fire appeared to the world as an articulate, intelligent teenager, a software engineering student, a young man who took care of his family planning for a new life outside Gaza. He filmed himself donating blood and encouraged others to do the same.\n“We saw so many injuries, many children are in dire need of blood… All we demand is for a ceasefire and this tragedy to end.”\nWe are only able to tell the story of al-Dalou family because of our own local journalist who went to meet the survivors. International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel.\nIn a video recorded in the tent where he died Sha'aban described how his family had been displaced five times since the war began a year ago. He had two sisters, and two younger brothers.\n“We live in very hard circumstances,” he said. “We suffer from various things such as homelessness, limited food, and extremely limited medicine.”\nIn the background, as he speaks, there is the loud mechanical hum of an Israeli observation drone, a constant in the daily and nightly soundtrack of Gaza.\nThe surviving brother of Sha'aban and Abdulrahman, Mohammed al-Dalou, told the BBC that he had tried to go into the flames to rescue his older brother.\nBut other injured people had held him back, fearing he too would be killed. Mohammed did not sleep in the family tent, but outside on the street where he kept watch over their piled belongings.\n“I was screaming for someone to let me go, but in vain… My brother’s leg was trapped and he couldn’t free himself. I think you saw it in the video. He was raising his hand.\n\"That was my brother. He was my support in this world.”\nSha'aban would come and wake him for prayers in the morning with a bottle of water and he would tell him: “I’ll work for you.”\nMohammed recalled how the brothers set up a stall at the gates of the hospital selling food that the family made.\n“We managed everything with our hard work. Everything we had was from our effort. We would get food and drink… then everything was lost.”\nHe saw the burned bodies, but could only identify his mother. Although her remains had been mutilated by fire, he recognised a distinctive bracelet.\n“Without it, I wouldn’t have known she was my mother. Her hand was detached from her body, but the bracelet was still on it. I took it off her hand.”\nThis is his only memento of the woman who was “the kindness in our home\".\nThe al-Dalou family is in shock. The survivors mourn the dead. Our BBC colleague asked Mohammed about the psychological cost of seeing his loved ones die.\n“I can’t describe it. I can’t describe how I felt. I want to explain it to people, but I can’t. I can’t describe it. I saw my brother burning in front of me, and my mother too.”\nThen, as if he is posing a question on behalf of the dead, he asks:  “What more do you need, and you stay silent? You see us burning, and you stay silent.”\nAdditional reporting by Haneen Abdeen and Alice Doyard",

            "content": "Hospitals and medical facilities have become caught up in intense fighting as Israel presses its offensive against Hamas in Gaza City.\nThe focus of attention has been on Al-Shifa, Gaza's largest hospital, where thousands are trapped by nearby battles, but other facilities are also reporting a lack of supplies and power because of fighting.\nIsrael says it is not targeting hospitals directly but acknowledges \"clashes\" around Al-Shifa and other facilities.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) says 36 health facilities including 22 hospitals have been damaged since the war began on 7 October, and only a handful are now still operational.\nHere is what the BBC knows about the situation at the main facilities in northern Gaza.\nThe WHO said on Sunday that Al-Shifa in Gaza City - the territory's largest with 700 beds - had ceased to function and that the situation inside was \"dire and perilous\".\nThe surrounding streets are engulfed by fighting between Hamas and Israeli forces. Critical infrastructure has been damaged,according to the UN.\nIsrael says Hamas fighters operate in tunnels underneath the hospital - a claim which Hamas denies.\nStaff inside say it is impossible to leave without risking injury or death.\nThe WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on X that \"constant gunfire and bombings in the area\" had \"exacerbated the already critical circumstances\".\nMultiple reports from inside say there are no food and no fuel to run generators. Solar energy is being used to power a few critical systems.\nThere have been communication blackouts - the Doctors Without Borders charity was unable to contact its members inside Gaza over the weekend. Attempts by the BBC to contact workers have often been unsuccessful.\nThe Hamas-run health ministry has said there are at least 2,300 people still inside the hospital - up to 650 patients, 200-500 staff and around 1,500 people seeking shelter.\nThis number includes newborn babies being kept in a surgical theatre at the site.\nStaff say that three of 39 infants in their care died over the weekend for lack of incubators. Surviving babies were at serious risk of death, according to doctors.\nThe Israel Defense Force's (IDF) chief spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said on Saturday that Israel would provide assistance to evacuate the babies to a \"safer hospital\".\nHowever, that evacuation had yet to happen as of Monday afternoon.\nHospital staff have told the BBC that moving the babies safely would require sophisticated equipment, and that there is no \"safer hospital\" inside Gaza.\nMark Regev, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said that the 300 litres offered would have been enough for the babies and more could be provided.\n\"Hamas did not want to accept solutions for the lack of fuel needed to save the babies,\" he said, adding: \"We provided fuel and they [Hamas] refused to take it.\"\nOn Saturday, Colonel Moshe Tetro of the IDF said there were clashes nearby, but no shooting at the hospital itself, and no siege.\nAnyone who wanted to leave, he said, could do so. He insisted that to say otherwise was a lie.\nMarwan Abu Saada, a surgeon in Shifa, told the BBC that there was bombing around the hospital and ambulances could not get in.\nThe IDF also said efforts to deliver 300 litres of fuel to Shifa on Sunday had failed because Hamas had refused to accept it - something Hamas denied.\nMr Abu Saada told the BBC on the same day that 300 litres would \"last 30 minutes\" - the hospital needs 10,000 litres a day to operate normally.\nOn top of this is the growing risk of disease from lack of sanitation and the decomposition of dead bodies that cannot be refrigerated.\nMr Abu Saada said that attempts to bury the dead had been thwarted by fighting around the complex, and the morgue refrigerator had failed for lack of power.\nThere were 100 bodies unburied in the hospital courtyard, he added.\nDr Marwan Al-Barsh, director general of Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, said that as well as the courtyard, the hospital's mortuaries were also filled with corpses.\nHe added that hospital officials had tried to bury those who had died in the hospital, but that people had been unable to leave without coming under fire.\nIsrael says it knows \"with certainty\" that there is a Hamas command centre underneath Shifa.\nIt has shared a 3-D representation of what it said were a network of tunnels under the hospital, and recordings it says are of Hamas fighters discussing them.\nHamas denies it is using the hospital or that it has an operations centre underneath. Doctors inside insist there is no Hamas presence there. The BBC's Gaza correspondent Rushdi Abualouf said that he had never seen \"any military capability\" inside the hospital, but acknowledged it was difficult to verify either Israel's or Hamas's claims.\nWHO's Dr Tedros said on 10 November that the hospitals that were functioning in the Gaza Strip were \"operating way beyond their capacities\".\nDr Ghassan Abu Sittah, a doctor working at Al-Ahli in northern Gaza, told the BBC that the hospital was now taking all of the wounded from Gaza City but that it did not have the resources to cope.\nHe said that ambulances were arriving with wounded people every 10 minutes, and that hospital staff did not have access to a blood bank, which he said was surrounded by Israeli tanks.\n\"We don't have an x-ray technician and we are short of medication to the point where we're having to do extremely painful procedures on large wounds to keep them clean with no analgesia, no anaesthetic,\" he said.\nHe added that operating rooms were being saved for life-saving surgeries \"because we don't have enough resources to treat everybody\".\nLast month Al-Ahli wasthe scene of a deadly blastthat was at the centre of competing claims between Israel and Hamas about who was responsible.\nThe Gaza Strip's second largest hospital after Al-Shifa has, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent, ceased to be operational.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said on Saturday that its teams were trapped inside with 500 patients and around 14,000 displaced people, mostly women and children.\nOn Sunday it stated that the hospital was \"out of service... no longer operational... due to the depletion of available fuel and power outage\".\nIt added that the hospital \"has been left to fend for itself under ongoing Israeli bombardment, posing severe risks to the medical staff, patients and displaced civilians\".\nIt also said that an \"evacuation convoy\" travelling from Khan Younis in southern Gaza towards Al-Quds hospital had had to turn back after experiencing \"relentless bombardment\". It added that those trapped in the hospital were without food, water or electricity.\nDoctors Without Borders said on Saturday it had lost contact with a surgeon working and sheltering in Al-Quds with his family.\nA spokesman for the Red Crescent told Reuters news agency that the hospital had been cut off for nearly a week, with \"no way in, no way out\", and the surrounding area was under constant attack.\nThe small Rantisi Specialised Hospital for Children and the nearby Al-Nasr hospital, in the north of Gaza City, were evacuated on Friday save for a handful of patients and staff. Rantisi had Gaza's only paediatric cancer ward.\nThe IDF released to the BBC details of phone conversations between an official at Rantisi and a senior officer in the IDF, in which they discussed arrangements to get ambulances to evacuate patients.\nThe hospital official asked about hundreds of displaced civilians camped out at the two hospitals. The Israeli officer told them to leave via the main entrance at 11:20 and explained in detail which streets they should walk along to leave Gaza City.\nAnd he twice told the hospital official to make sure civilians were carrying something white to show they were not combatants.\n\"They will all go out with their hands in the air,\" the hospital official said. \"Perfect,\" the Israeli said.\nIn a video verified by the BBC, peoplewaving white flagswere seen apparently coming under gunfire on as they attempted to leave Al-Nasr on Friday. It was not clear where the gunshots had come from or who had fired them.\nDr Bakr Gaoud, the head of Rantisi, was quoted by the New York Times as saying that Israeli forces had arrived at the end of last week and provided maps showing a safe way out.\n\"We dragged our patients out of their beds,\" he said, adding that the patients in the worst condition were sent to Al-Shifa, which was already overwhelmed and ceasing to function.\nEveryone else, he said, had made their way to southern Gaza away from the main fighting.\nOn Monday evening IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari showed journalists what he said was evidence of Hamas infrastructure at Rantisi - video of explosives, suicide vests and even a motorcycle used in the 7 October attacks, hidden in a basement.\nHe showed video of a deep shaft with a ladder down the side which he said was the entrance to a tunnel that was next to both a school and the hospital, adding it was \"nothing else but a terror tunnel\".\nThe UN's office for humanitarian affairs said in its Sunday night update that the Swedish clinic had been \"hit and destroyed\" by an air strike on Saturday.\nThere were around 500 people sheltering there, it reported, and the casualty toll was \"unclear\".\nOn Monday morning, BBC Gaza correspondent Rushdi Abu Alouf spoke to Maryam al-Arabeed, a 65-year-old woman who said Israeli soldiers had entered the facility on Sunday night and moved everyone out. She said she had then watched \"an Israeli bulldozer completely demolish the building\".\n\"They took the young men out including my three sons and separated the women and children,\" she told the BBC.\nShe added that she did not know where her sons or relatives were.\n\"In start contrast to Hamas's intentional attacks on Israeli men, women and children, the IDF follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm,\" the Israeli military added.",

Civilians in the area are repeatedly called upon to evacuate southwards for their own safety,\" it added.\nEarlier, the Hamas-run health ministry said 13 people were killed in a blast outside Al-Shifa.\nIn a statement posted on X (formerly Twitter), the Palestinian Red Crescent said \"the deliberate targeting of medical teams constitutes a grave violation of the Geneva Conventions, a war crime\".\nBBC Verify studied three videos - one of which is very graphic - and established that they were filmed outside the hospital and were uploaded on Friday afternoon.\nIn one video, people were filmed lying in pools of blood in the road next to vehicles - some were severely injured and some were not moving.\nThere is no crater visible in the footage we've seen so far, and no debris or shrapnel visible. There's damage to the front of an ambulance and some cars on the road have smashed windows.\nIn its statement, the Palestinian Red Crescent said the convoy was struck twice on its way to the Al-Shifa hospital - once 1km (0.62 miles) away and a second time outside the hospital gate, where it said it had arrived to unload patients.\nA Hamas government statement said Israeli forces targeted \"a convoy of ambulances which was transporting the wounded\" from Al-Shifa hospital Gaza City towards Rafah in the south.\nEgypt's health ministry said just 17 wounded Palestinians were evacuated for treatment in Egyptian hospitals on Friday instead of the 28 originally planned because of the \"events\" at Al-Shifa.\nThe head of the World Health Organization said he was \"utterly shocked\" by the explosion at Al-Shifa.\n\"We reiterate: patients, health workers, facilities and ambulances must be protected at all times. Always,\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted on X.\nBisan Owda, a Palestinian filmmaker, was nearby when the attack happened.\n\"Some people lost their legs, lost their hands, people were trying to carry injuries,\" she told the BBC. \"People were crying, trying to find each other.\"\nIn addition to the patients at Al-Shifa, thousands more people are sheltering from Israeli air strikes there.\nMs Owda said many were unable to find space inside the hospital and were sleeping in nearby streets,.\nThe Israeli military says there is a major Hamas headquarters situated underneath the hospital.\nIn a separate incident in Gaza City on Friday, Gaza health officials said several people were killed and wounded in an Israeli strike on a school where hundreds were taking shelter. Israel has not yet commented.\nIsrael began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 240 others.\nIt has also launched a ground operation and on Thursday said its forces had encircled Gaza City.\nIsrael has warned people to move to the south of the Gaza Strip and hundreds of thousands have left Gaza City and northern areas. But many thousands remain in northern Gaza.\nContinued Israeli air strikes in the southern Gaza Strip, where Israel had told Gazans to go, as well as overcrowded conditions there have prompted some Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza,\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since 7 October.",

            "content": "An Israeli air strike has destroyed part of al Ahli Arab Hospital, the last fully functional hospital in Gaza City.\nWitnesses said the strike destroyed the intensive care and surgery departments of the hospital.\nVideo posted online appeared to show huge flames and smoke rising after missiles hit a two-storey building. People, including some patients still in hospital beds, were filmed rushing away from the site.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it targeted the hospital because it contained a \"command and control centre used by Hamas\". No casualties were reported, according to Gaza's civil emergency service.\nHowever, one child, who previously suffered a head injury, died as a result of \"the rushed evacuation process\", according to a statement from the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, part of the Anglican Church, which runs the hospital.\nSurrounding buildings, including St Philip's church, were also damaged, the diocese said.\nIt added that it was \"appalled\" at the bombing of the hospital \"on the morning of Palm Sunday and the beginning of Holy Week\".\nGaza's Hamas-run health ministry said al Ahli Arab Hospital's building was \"completely destroyed\", leading to the \"forced displacement of patients and hospital staff\".\nThe IDF said it had taken steps \"to mitigate harm to civilians or to the hospital compound, including issuing advanced warnings in the area of the terror infrastructure, the use of precise munitions, and aerial surveillance\".\nA local journalist, who was working at the hospital, said the IDF had phoned a doctor who was operating in the emergency department and asked them to evacuate the hospital immediately.\n\"All patients and displaced people must go out to a safe distance,\" the officer reportedly said.\nFootage on social media showed staff and patients leaving the building while it was still dark outside.\nDozens of Palestinians, including women and children, were also seen fleeing from a courtyard inside the hospital where they had been seeking shelter.\nKhalil Bakr told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme that he and his three injured daughters had fled the hospital with only a couple of minutes to spare before it was bombed.\n\"It was terrifying,\" he said. \"The whole situation was difficult because I have already been injured. And as for my three daughters, one had her leg amputated, the other had her hand amputated, and the third had her body full of platinum plates.\"\nHe added: \"Only two minutes separated us from death.\"\nAl Ahli Arab - a small medical facility before the war - was the only fully functional hospital in Gaza City, following the destruction ofAl-Shifa medical complexand other hospitals in the northern part of the Strip.\nWorld Health Organization director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the hospital was out of service following the evacuation order and attack, according to an update he received from the hospital's director.\nDr Ghebreyesus highlighted how a child had died after a disruption to care, and said the hospital had been forced to move 50 patients to other hospitals, but was unable to move 40 critical patients and could not receive new patients until repairs are carried out.\n\"Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law. Attacks on health care must stop,\" he stated.\nIn its statement, the Hamas-run government media office condemned the attack.\nIsrael was \"committing a horrific crime by targeting al Ahli Arab, which houses hundreds of patients and medical staff\", it said.\nUK Foreign Minister David Lammy said such \"deplorable attacks must end\", adding: \"Israel's attacks on medical facilities have comprehensively degraded access to healthcare in Gaza.\"\nThe Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell said in a statement: \"For the only Christian hospital in Gaza to be attacked on Palm Sunday is especially appalling.\n\"I share in the grief of our Palestinian brothers and sisters in the Diocese of Jerusalem. I pray for the staff and patients of the hospital, and for the family of the boy who tragically died during the evacuation.\"\nIn October 2023, an explosion at the same hospitalkilled hundreds of people.\nPalestinian officials blamed an Israeli strike for the blast. Israel said the blast was caused by a failed rocket launch by the armed group Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which denied responsibility.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 Israelis were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 50,933 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nOf those, 1,563 have been killed since 18 March, when Israel restarted its offensive in the Gaza Strip, the ministry said.",

            "content": "Residents of Gaza have cautiously welcomed reports of a temporary humanitarian pause to allow aid into the besieged enclave, but many say the relief must be the beginning of a broader, lasting solution to the deepening crisis.\nIsrael's military said it will open humanitarian corridors to allow convoys of food and medicine to enter, after warnings of starvation and weeks of international pressure.\nFor months, Gaza's population of more than two million has faced extreme shortages of food, clean water, and basic medical supplies as bombardment and border closures have brought daily life to a standstill.\n\"Of course I feel a bit of hope again, but also worried that starvation would continue once the pause is over,\" said Rasha Al-Sheikh Khalil, a 39-year-old mother-of-four in Gaza City.\nShe added: \"One convoy of aid or a few air drop packages won't be enough. We need a real solution, an end to this nightmare, an end to the war.\"\nIsrael's announcement on Sunday came after it said it made an airdrop of aid into Gaza of \"seven packages of aid containing flour, sugar and canned food\".\nJordan and the UAE also say they have a plan, backed by the UK, to drop aid into the territory, but aid agencies have said such moves would do little to mitigate the hunger of Gazans.\n\"This isn't just about quantity of food, it's about quality,\" said Neveen Saleh, a mother-of-six.\n\"We haven't eaten a single fresh fruit or vegetable in four months. There's no chicken, no meat, no eggs. All we have are canned foods that are often expired and flour.\"\nThe Hamas-run health ministry said dozens of people were dying from malnutrition. On Sunday it put the number dead from malnutrition since the start of the conflict at 133, with the majority dying in recent weeks.\nIsrael denied what it called \"the false claim of deliberate starvation\" in Gaza.\nMedical experts in Gaza say malnutrition is becoming widespread, especially among children and those with specific dietary needs.\nOne of the most affected groups are those with gluten intolerance, who are unable to consume wheat-based products like bread, which now make up the bulk of available food.\n\"My wife and one of my five children have celiac disease,\" said Rami Taha who lives in central Gaza.\n\"Before the war, I used to buy them gluten-free products. Now, there is nothing. I have to take them to the hospital every few days just to get IV fluids.\"\nThere have been reports on Sunday of aid lorries entering the strip. The UN and other aid organisations have called for the unrestricted entry and delivery of aid.\nGazans are anxiously awaiting the entry of food aid lorries.\nDozens of empty vehicles were seen heading in convoys towards Zikim in northern Gaza, Kissufim in central Gaza, and the Kerem Shalom crossing in the far south-east of the strip.\nMeanwhile, local markets witnessed increased activity as merchants rushed to sell food they had been hoarding.\nPrices remain extremely high but have dropped compared to previous days - a kilo of flour has fallen to $15 (£11.16), down from $85 (£63.26) just four days ago.\nMany Gazans say they worry that international attention will fade once a few symbolic aid deliveries are made.\n\"This is not a permanent solution, it's like giving painkillers to a cancer patient without treating them,\" said Ahmad Taha, a shopkeeper in northern Gaza.\nAs efforts to revive broader ceasefire seems faltering, the people of Gaza remain trapped between hope and despair - thankful for any aid, but yearning for a lasting peace.\nIsrael launched a war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 59,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",

            "content": "As thousands of Gazans made the journey back to their neighbourhoods following the ceasefire, many of them already knew their homes were in ruins.\nThe prospect of rebuilding homes, businesses and all the institutions and services needed for a return to normal life in Gaza is daunting by any measure: the UN estimates thatthe damage amounts to $70bn.\nAs Prof Andreas Krieg, a Middle East security expert from King's College London, says: \"It's worse than starting from scratch - here you aren't starting in the sand, you are starting with rubble.\"\nThe level of destruction on the strip is \"now in the region of 84%. In certain parts of Gaza, like in Gaza City, it's even up to 92%\", says Jaco Cilliers, UN Development Programme special representative for the Palestinians.\nThis damage has created colossal amounts of rubble. Assessments by BBC Verify based on recent satellite data suggest there could be over 60 million tonnes of debris waiting to be cleared in Gaza.\nAny process of post-conflict reconstruction must begin by clearing the remnants of war.\nThe many millions of tonnes of rubble now littering the Gaza Strip are not just piles of concrete and twisted metal. They also contain human remains and unexploded bombs.\n\"From a safety and humane perspective, the first thing you have to do is make the sites that have been bombed-out safe,\" says former JCB executive Philip Bouverat.\nThere follows a process of sorting, separation and crushing the debris. After materials like plastic and steel are removed, the remaining concrete can be ground up and reused.\nThis will lay the foundations of construction, but building efforts will require the mass import of materials.\n\"This isn't going to be done by trucks coming across the border. The first thing we need to do is build a deep-water port, because then you can bring thousands of container-loads in\", Mr Bouverat added.\nWhen the sites are cleared, then essential services such as water, sewerage and electricity can be restored, he says.\nClean water is a major immediate need for Gazans. According to estimates from Unicef, more than 70% of the territory's 600 water and sanitation facilities have been damaged or destroyed since 7 October 2023.\nAfter the recent announcement of a ceasefire, Israeli soldiers posed in front of a wastewater treatment plant in Gaza City that had been set on fire. The damage came just before Israel's military withdrew from a position near this infrastructure.\nWastewater treatment is critical for preventing the build-up of sewage and the spread of disease. Doctors have said Gaza has high rates of diarrhoeal diseases, which can kill children, and a risk of cholera in some areas.\nIn satellite imagery, you can see damage to the bio-towers of the Sheikh Ejleen wastewater treatment plant, which are the main components used for treating sewage.\nThere are six wastewater treatment plants in Gaza. \"All of them are damaged,\" said Maher Najjar, deputy director at Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU) which oversees and manages repairs for Gaza's water infrastructure.\nSince the beginning of the war, repairs have been hugely hampered by the immediate danger from Israeli air and artillery attacks and a shortage of tools, he said. Some facilities have been attacked again after being repaired.\nThe IDF said its actions are \"based on military necessity and with accordance to international law\", as it tries to prevent Hamas \"threatening the citizens of Israel\".\nAlongside facilities that treat sewage, Gaza has separate plants that provide clean drinking water and which have also experienced major damage.\nSatellite images from April 2024 show a seawater desalination plant which supplied northern Gaza and Gaza City still intact. But by early May, it had been destroyed.\n\"We are talking about damaged water wells, damaged networks, reservoirs, carrier lines. It's very hard to know where to start. To begin with we need at least $50m to return around 20% of the services to the population,\" Mr Najjar said.\nSatellite images show the devastation in an area of Sheikh Radwan, a neighbourhood in the north-east of Gaza City.\nIn August before the IDF occupied the city, which it called the \"last stronghold\" of Hamas, many streets appeared largely intact. By last week, whole swathes of the neighbourhood had been flattened as the IDF established a base.\nOver the course of the war, the UN's satellite centre Unosat estimates a total of 282,904 houses and apartments across Gaza have been damaged or destroyed.\nBut these figures are likely to be an underestimate, because they do not yet include the recent military operations in Gaza City, such as the destruction in Sheikh Radwan.\nThe chart below shows how the rate of housing damage increased sharply in the middle of 2024 - coinciding with IDF operations in Rafah, which left much of the city in ruins. Another significant spike is likely to have occurred as a result of the Gaza City occupation.\nGaza City's Hamas-run Municipality has said that 90% of its roads have also been damaged.\nAccording to Shelly Culbertson, a senior policy researcher at the Washington-based think tank, RAND Corporation, the rebuilding of Gaza's housing \"could take decades.\"\n\"After the Israeli bombing of Gaza in 2014 and 2021 reconstruction of housing was slow because Israel wouldn't allow in a lot of construction materials because they had dual-use purposes,\" she said.\n\"If you rebuild now the way they did in 2014 and 2021 it will take 80 years. If there's good planning, it could take less time,\" she said.\n\"Good planning is designing camps that can turn into neighbourhoods and helping people move back into and rebuild damaged homes.\"\nGaza's power system was under strain before the current war. Rolling blackouts were frequent, and most Gazans lived on limited hours of electricity each day.\nHistorically, most of Gaza's electricity supply comes from power lines connecting it to Israel and the diesel-fired Gaza Power Plant, with some rooftop and public-facility solar panels added in recent years.\nSince 11 October 2023, Gaza has experienced a near-total electricity blackout after Israel cut external electricity. One exception was a direct feed to the South Gaza desalination plant, which supplies clean drinking water. Israel reconnected its feed to this plant on 14 November 2024 and then cut it again on 9 March 2025, before reconnecting it once more.\nThe Gaza Power Plant has been inoperable due to a lack of fuel, and solar facilities have suffered widespread damage.\nWith the grid largely down, essential services have depended on limited diesel generators and the remaining solar panels.\nA joint assessment from earlier this year by the World Bank, European Union and UN estimated that more than 80% of power generation and distribution assets have either been destroyed or are non-operational since the start of the war, at an estimated cost in damages of more than $494m.\nGaza Electricity Distribution Cooperation (Gedco), the company responsible for managing electricity supply across the Gaza Strip, say 70% of its buildings and facilities have been destroyed since October 2023.\nAt the end of last month, we verified video of the company's headquarters being struck.\nIn a statement following the event, Gedco said the attack had \"directly affected the company's ability to manage its administrative and technical businesses\".\nThe satellite image below of one area east of Jabalia shows how 4 sq km of crops - likely olive and citrus trees - were wiped out over the course of the war.\nRunning through the razed ground is a road or track established by the IDF, probably to provide access to northern areas of nearby Gaza City.\nAnalysis by Prof He Yin of Kent State University found that across the Gaza Strip, 82.4% of annual crops and more than 97% of tree crops were likely to have suffered damage during the war up to 10 August this year.\nThe decline of agriculture, coupled with prolonged restrictions on aid, drove severe food insecurity throughout the conflict, culminating in a famine declaration in Gaza City in September.\nUnosat attributes this decline to the \"impact of activities such as razing, heavy vehicle activity, bombing, shelling, and other conflict related dynamics\".\nMr Bouverat says that in order for agriculture to recover, the land needs to be cleared of unexploded bombs, shells and mines \"pretty urgently\". \"If they can grow their own crops, they can feed themselves, and the sooner we do that the better,\" he says.\nAbout half of Gaza's population before the war was aged under 18, so rebuilding schools is essential for any return to normal life.\nSchool buildings became shelters for displaced Palestinians throughout the conflict, and were frequently targeted by IDF forces with the justification that they housed \"command and control\" centres for Hamas and affiliated groups.\nThe UN relief agency for Palestine, Unrwa, which once operated 288 schools in Gaza, says 91.8% of all of school buildings will require \"full reconstruction or major rehabilitation work to be functional again\".\nHigher education institutions have also not been spared.\nFor example, in December 2023, the al-Azhar University to the south of Gaza City was blown up by Israeli troops. The site is now part of the Netzarim Corridor, one of several miilitarised zones established by the IDF over the course of the war.\nThe same fate befell the Israa University less than 2km away. which was demolished by IDF troops after serving as a temporary base for several weeks.",

            "content": "Gaza is experiencing a health \"catastrophe\" that will last for \"generations to come\", the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned.\nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a massive increase in aid is needed to begin to address the complex needs of the Strip's population.\nIsrael has allowed more medical supplies and other aid to cross into Gaza since a ceasefire with Hamas came into effect on 10 October, but Dr Tedros said levels are below those needed to rebuild the territory's healthcare system.\nHis intervention comes as the US attempts toshore up the ceasefire it helped to brokerfollowing an outbreak of violence at the weekend.\nThe agreement has been described by the White House as the first phase of a 20-point peace plan that includes an increase to the amount of aid entering Gaza, and supplies distributed \"without interference\" from either side.\nDr Tedros told the Today programme he welcomed the ceasefire deal but said the increase in aid that followed has been smaller than expected.\nAsked about the situation on the ground, he said Gazans had experienced famine, \"overwhelming\" injuries, a collapsed healthcare system, and outbreaks of disease fuelled by the destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure.\nHe continued: \"On top of that, [there is] restricted access to humanitarian aid. This is a very fatal combination, so that makes [the situation] catastrophic and beyond words.\"\nAsked about long-term health prospects in Gaza, he added: \"If you take the famine and combine it with a mental health problem which we see is rampant, then the situation is a crisis for generations to come.\"\nTom Fletcher, head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs,said earlier this weekthat aid groups are \"turning the tide on the starvation crisis\" but that \"far more\" was needed.\nOn Tuesday, the UN's World Food Programme said lorries carrying more than 6,700 tonnes of food had entered since 10 October, but that was still considerably below its 2,000-tonnes-a-day target.\nSix hundred aid lorries a day need to be arriving in Gaza but the average is between 200 and 300, Dr Tedros said, as he called on Israeli authorities to \"de-link\" aid and the wider conflict.\nOn Sunday, Israel temporarily halted aid deliveries after it said two Israeli troops were killed in an attack by Hamas gunmen in Gaza. Hamas said at the time it was not aware of the clashes.\nThe Israeli military responded with a series of air strikes across the territory, killing dozens of Palestinians.\nThe aid deliveries resumed the following day after heavy international pressure.\nDr Tedros said aid should not be \"weaponised\" and called on Israel not to impose conditions on its delivery, including over the return of the remains of dead hostages still in Gaza, which has become a key point of contention during the ceasefire.\nHamas has committed to returning the bodies but so far has transferred only 15 of 28, saying it has not been able to retrieve the rest.\nTwenty living Israeli hostages were released by Hamas last week in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails.\nDr Tedros told Today: \"There should be full access, there should not be any condition, especially after all the living hostages were released, and a good part of the remains are transferred. I did not expect there would be additional restrictions.\"\nAsked about the role the US should play, Dr Tedros said \"since the US has brokered the peace deal it has the responsibility of making sure that all sides are respecting\" it.\nIsrael is currently operating two crossings - Kerem Shalom in the south-east, and Kissufim in central Gaza - but it has continued to face calls from aid groups for all the access routes it controls to be restored.\nDr Tedros said \"all available crossings\" were needed to get enough aid into Gaza, and called on Israel to allow aid groups previously been denied registration back into the territory, saying: \"You can't have a scaled up response without those who can deliver on the ground.\"\nHe also said supplies intended be used to restore Gaza's health system have been confiscated at the border because Israeli authorities say they could have a military use.\n\"If you are going to build a field hospital, you need the canvas and the pillars [for tents],\" he continued. \"So if the pillars are removed, because of an excuse that they could be dual-use, then you can't have a tent.\"\nThousands of Palestinians are waiting for weekly medical evacuation flights, Dr Tedros said, though none have taken off for two weeks due to religious holidays in Israel. He said 700 people have previously died while waiting for medical evacuation and called on the number of flights to be increased.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others as hostages.\nAt least 68,229 have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nIn July, a UN-backed bodyconcluded that famine had occurred in Gaza, though Israel disputed the findings, saying there was \"no starvation\".\nThe UN has previously estimated it will cost $70bn (£52bn) to reconstruct Gaza. Dr Tedros said around 10% of that figure would need to be spent on its badly damaged health system.\nHe continued: \"We have been saying for a long time that peace is the best medicine.\n\"The ceasefire we have is a very fragile one and some people have died even after the ceasefire because it was broken a couple of times.\n\"What is very sad is many people were cheering in the streets because they were very happy there was a peace deal. Imagine, [some of] those same people are dead after they were told the war is over.\"",

            "content": "At least 81 Palestinians have been killed and more than 400 injured in Israeli strikes across Gaza in the 24 hours until midday on Saturday, the Hamas-run health ministry said.\nIn one incident, at least 11 people, including children, were killed after a strike near a stadium in Gaza City, Al-Shifa hospital staff and witnesses told news agencies. The stadium was being used to house displaced people, living in tents.\nFootage verified by the BBC shows people digging through the sand with their bare hands and spades to find bodies.\nThe Israeli military said it was \"unaware of injuries as a result of the strike\" aside from \"a suspicious individual who posed a threat\" to its forces.\nMeanwhile, US President Donald Trump said he was hopeful a ceasefire could be agreed in the next week.\nQatari mediators said they hoped US pressure could achieve a deal, following a truce between Israel and Iran that ended the 12-day conflict between the countries.\nIn March, a two-month ceasefire collapsed when Israel launched fresh strikes on Gaza. The ceasefire deal - which started on 19 January - was set up to have three stages, but did not make it past the first stage.\nStage two included establishing a permanent ceasefire, the return of remaining living hostages in Gaza in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.\nOn Thursday, a senior Hamas official told the BBC mediators have intensified their efforts to broker a new ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, but that negotiations with Israel remain stalled.\nA rally was organised on Saturday evening in Tel Aviv calling for a deal to free the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Organisers said \"the time has come to end the fighting and bring everyone home in one phase\".\nMeanwhile, Israeli attacks in Gaza continue. Friday evening's strike near the Palestine Stadium in Gaza City killed at least 11 people, hospital staff and witnesses said.\nOne witness said they were sitting when they \"suddenly heard a huge explosion\" after a road was hit.\n\"This area was packed with tents - now the tents are under the sand. We spent hours digging with our bare hands,\" Ahmed Qishawi told the Reuters news agency.\nHe said there are \"no wanted people here, nor any terrorists as they [Israelis] claim... [there are] only civilian residents, children, who were targeted with no mercy,\" he said.\nThe BBC has verified footage showing civilians and emergency services digging through the sandy ground with their hands and spades to find bodies.\nFourteen more people were reported killed, some of them children, in strikes on an apartment block and a tent in the al-Mawasi area.\nThe strike in al-Mawasi killed three children and their parents, who died while they were asleep, relatives told the Associated Press.\n\"What did these children do to them? What is their fault?\" the children's grandmother, Suad Abu Teima, told the news agency.\nMore people were reported killed on Saturday afternoon after an air strike on the Tuffah neighbourhood near Jaffa School, where hundreds of displaced Gazans were sheltering.\nThe strike killed at least eight people, including five children, the Palestinian health ministry said.\nOne witness Mohammed Haboub told Reuters that his nephews, father and the children of his neighbours were killed in the strike.\n\"We didn't do anything to them, why do they harm us? Did we harm them? We are civilians,\" he told the news agency.\nThe health ministry said ambulance and civil defence crews were facing difficulties in reaching a number of victims trapped under the rubble and on the roads, due to the impossibility of movement in some of the affected areas.\nAsked about the strike on the Tuffah neighbourhood, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that it \"struck a suspicious individual who posed a threat to IDF troops operating in the northern Gaza Strip\".\n\"Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians\", it said, adding that it was \"unaware of injuries as a result of the strike, besides the individual struck\".\nThe IDF released a statement on Saturday evening saying it had killed Hakham Muhammad Issa al-Issa, a senior figure in Hamas's military wing, in the area of Sabra in Gaza City on Friday.\nThe IDF said he was one of the founding members of Hamas's military wing, a member of Hamas's general security council, and played a \"significant role in the planning and execution\" of Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel.\nThe Israeli military launched its bombardment of Gaza in response to the attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 56,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

            "content": "The head of the World Health Organization has called for an end to attacks on hospitals in Gaza.\n\"Hospitals in Gaza have once again become battlegrounds and the health system is under severe threat,\"Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\nHis warning came after the last functioning hospital in besieged northern Gaza, Kamal Adwan, was raided and forcibly evacuated by the Israeli military on Friday and two hospitals in Gaza City were attacked on Sunday.\nThe military said two of the sites were being used as Hamas command centres, but it denied striking the third.\nDr Tedros also joined rights groups and relatives calling for the immediate release of Kamal Adwan's director, Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, who was detained by Israeli forces.\nThe Israeli military said on Saturday that his hospital was a Hamas \"stronghold\" and that troops had killed about 20 \"terrorists\" and detained 240 others during the raid. It added that Dr Abu Safiya was among those taken for questioning and that he was \"suspected of being a Hamas terrorist operative\".\nThe military did not provide evidence for the allegations, which Hamas dismissed as \"lies\".\nUS-based MedGlobal condemned the detention of Dr Abu Safiya, who was its lead physician in Gaza, as \"not only unjust\" but also \"a violation of international humanitarian law, which upholds the protection of medical personnel in conflict zones\".\nHis family expressed concern about his health, saying he was still recovering from severe injuries sustained in an attack last month and that he was likely to be suffering from the cold because he had been forced to strip off his clothes.\nDr Abu Safiya's son, Elias, told BBC Arabic that relevant authorities had confirmed reports that he was being held at Sde Teiman military base in southern Israel, where Israeli forces have taken many detainees from Gaza for interrogation.\nSeveral Palestinians recently released from the detention facility over the weekend also said they had seen Dr Abu Safiya there or heard his name being read out,according to CNN.\nDr Tedros said Kamal Adwan was out of service following the raid and that its critically ill patients had been transferred to the \"out of function\" Indonesian hospital, which he warned was severely damaged and had no ability to provide care.\n\"Amid ongoing chaos in northern Gaza, WHO and partners today delivered basic medical and hygiene supplies, food and water to Indonesian hospital and transferred 10 critical patients to al-Shifa Hospital [in Gaza City],\" he said.\n\"Four patients were detained during the transfer. We urge Israel to ensure their health care needs and rights are upheld.\"\nGaza's Hamas-run health ministry said one of those detained patients was in a critical condition, and that seven patients and 10 medical staff remained at the Indonesian hospital.\nIsraeli forces launched a major ground offensive in the northern towns of Jabalia, Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun on 6 October, saying it was stopping Hamas from regrouping there. The UN says the areas are under near-total siege and that humanitarian assistance has been largely denied by Israeli forces for more than 11 weeks.\nDr Tedros also said al-Ahli hospital and al-Wafa Rehabilitation hospital in Gaza City \"also faced attacks\" and were both damaged.\nOn Sunday, seven people were killed and other seriously wounded in an Israeli strike on the upper floor of al-Wafa hospital, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency.\nThe Israeli military said the strike targeted Hamas fighters who were using the building as a command and control centre. It added that the building was not serving as a hospital at the time.\nBut a witness told the BBC there were patients and medical staff inside the hospital.\nA fourth-year medical student said she had been inside the hospital with her colleagues, getting ready to sit an exam, when it was bombed.\n\"There was heavy smoke and we nearly suffocated. Glass from destroyed windows fell over us. We took cover under the tables and then fled,\" she added.\n\"As we were coming down the stairs, we saw patients on wheelchairs, others being carried. Our professor suffered a head injury and was bleeding - some other colleagues had minor injuries.\"\nThe wounded were taken to the al-Ahli hospital, which Palestinian media said was hit by Israeli shelling earlier on Sunday.\nVideo footage posted onlineappeared to show damage to the top floor of one building at the site.\nHowever, the Israeli military denied on Monday that its forces had struck the hospital.\nA displaced man living in the vicinity of the al-Ahli hospital told BBC Arabic that he was afraid that it would be the next to be raided by Israeli forces.\n\"If they besiege us here, where can we go then? How long will this suffering continue? We have been displaced about six or seven times,\" he said. \"They have bombed all homes, schools and hospitals. There is no longer a safe place for us to take shelter in.\"\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) also warned on Monday that hostilities in and around hospitals had \"obliterated the healthcare system in northern Gaza, putting civilians at an unacceptably grave risk of going without lifesaving care\".\n\"Medical facilities have protections and civilians have protections in situations of conflict. These need to be respected and this is our constant call,\" spokeswoman Sarah Davies told the BBC.\n\"More aid, more supplies need to be able to enter Gaza and be safely distributed, and civilians need to have safe access to those essential services that they rely on to survive.\"\nIsrael launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 45,540 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.",

            "content": "Hundreds of activists, including Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg, have been detained by Israeli forces after a flotilla carrying aid bound for Gaza was intercepted.\nIsrael's Foreign Ministry said those involved in the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) were being transferred to an Israeli port to be deported.\nThe first boats were stopped about 70 nautical miles off the Gaza coast in international waters and others closer. Israel has been policing this area but does not have jurisdiction there.\nIsrael said its navy told the boats to change course as they were \"approaching an active combat zone and violating a lawful naval blockade\", while the GSF described the interceptions as \"illegal\".\nThe group said Israel's response was \"not an act of defence\", but \"a brazen act of desperation\".\nIt estimated 443 people were detained from the boats and alleged that many were assaulted with water cannon. Israel said all those detained were \"safe and in good health\".\nA growing number of countries have expressed concern over the incident, criticising Israel for staging the interception in international waters.\nColombian President Gustavo Petro has expelled all remaining Israeli diplomats from the country in response, and denounced the interception as an \"international crime by [Israel's Prime Minister] Netanyahu\".\nPetro also terminated Colombia's free trade agreement with Israel, in place since 2020, and called for the release of two Colombians who were aboard the flotilla.\nAmnesty International's Secretary General, Agnès Callamard, said Israel's blockade on Gaza was \"unlawful\" and that the \"decades-long impunity for Israel's blatant violations of international law must end\".\nHowever, Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni criticised the attempt to reach Gaza, saying: \"I continue to believe that all this brings no benefit to the Palestinian people.\"\nIsrael's Foreign Ministry posted footage from the interception showing Thunberg sitting on the deck of a boat, being handed water and a jacket by a member of the Israeli military. Detained activists are being taken to the port of Ashdod, Israel said.\n\"Greta and her friends are safe and healthy,\" the Israeli government said.\nIsrael has described the flotilla as \"provocation yachts\" and contends that it was justified in stopping the vessels before they entered the naval blockade of the waters that border Gaza.\nIt said one boat remained \"at a distance\" and would be intercepted if it approached the blockade.\nThat boat appeared to be the Marinette, which the GSF said was still in communication and carrying six people on board. The flotilla's tracking system showed it sailing in international waters a long distance from Gaza's coastline on Thursday afternoon.\nIsrael said none of the boats entered the blockade area, though the GSF tracking suggests one of its boats, the Mikeno, may have entered Gaza's territorial waters, but remains out of contact.\nA member of the legal team working with the GSF said there will be a further attempt to breach Israel's blockade \"in the coming days\".\nCaoimhe Butterly, who is aboard a vessel providing legal support and acting as an observer to the GSF, said: \"There is the expectation that it will be up to 13 vessels, ships and boats and that it will follow a similar route to Gaza.\"\nThis will be organised by a separate group, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which launched two previous attempts that were both intercepted.\nPeople have gathered in Greece, Italy, Germany, Tunisia and Turkey to protest against Israel's interception of the flotilla. Its actions have also drawn criticism from Pakistan, Bolivia and Malaysia.\nIn Italy, spontaneous rallies took place in some cities on Wednesday evening. Its main trade union CGIL confirmed it was backing a general strike on Friday in solidarity with Gaza and in response to what it said was the \"abandonment\" of Italian workers \"in open international waters\" by the Italian government.\nThe flotilla had been accompanied by Italian and Spanish naval vessels following alleged drone attacks and communications jamming of unclear origin, but these peeled away well before the interception began.\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, called for Israel to \"urgently lift the blockade on Gaza and allow the entry of life-saving material through all means possible\", adding in a statement that it must agree to facilitate impartial humanitarian relief schemes \"without hindrance\".\nThe UK Foreign Office said it had been in contact with the families of the British nationals aboard the boats, adding that it had contacted Israeli authorities to \"make clear we expect the situation to be resolved safely\".\nIrish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Harris called the reports \"concerning\" and said he expects Israel to uphold international law,with at least seven Irish citizens among the detained, including Sinn Féin Senator Chris Andrews.\nThe flotilla left Spain a month ago, with more than 40 ships and around 500 people aboard, including European parliamentarians, lawyers and activists, with the stated intention of taking aid directly into Gaza.\nIsrael has already blocked two attempts by activists to deliver aid by ship to Gaza, in June and July.\nWhile the Israeli government has characterised the flotilla as a \"selfie yacht\", Thunberg has pushed back against that criticism,telling the BBC on Sunday: \"I don't think anyone would risk their life for a publicity stunt.\"\nInternational aid agencies have been attempting to get food and medicine into the Palestinian territory but say Israel is restricting the flow of supplies.\nIsrael claims it is attempting to stop those supplies falling into the hands of Hamas. It and the US have backed an alternative food distribution system, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which the UN has branded unethical and \"inherently unsafe\".\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a UN-backed group consideredan impartial expert body,confirmed last month that there was famine in Gaza, and the UN's humanitarian chief said it was the direct result of Israel's \"systematic obstruction\" of aid entering the territory.\nNetanyahu has called this an \"outright lie\", rejecting the evidence presented by the IPC.",

            "content": "At least 46 people waiting for aid have been killed by Israeli fire in two incidents in central and southern Gaza, according to rescuers and hospitals.\nUN agencies have condemned the US and Israel-backed food distribution system, with one official calling it \"an abomination\" and \"a death trap\".\nSuch deadly incidents have recently become a near daily occurrence but have attracted relatively little attention outside Gaza since Israel attacked Iran more than a week ago.\nWithout including the latest deaths, the UN has said that more than 410 Palestinians are reported to have been killed by Israeli gunfire or shelling since the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) began work in late May.\n\"Why are our children's lives seen as so cheap?\" demanded Umm Raed al-Nuaizi, a widow whose son was shot and wounded after he went overnight to collect food for his hungry family in central Gaza.\n\"My son went to get a grain of flour so that he could eat and feed his siblings, and now he is in the intensive care unit.\"\nFootage from al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat showed chaotic scenes as young men with gunshot wounds were carried in, groaning in pain and some drenched in blood.\nSoon every bed was filled, and casualties covered the floor.\nAn older man was set down dead as his wife, bereft, cradled his face and wept.\nHospital officials and the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said that at least 21 people were killed and some 150 injured.\nWitnesses said that thousands had crowded near a site run by the GHF in an Israeli military zone when soldiers opened fire.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a gathering had been \"identified in an area adjacent to IDF troops operating in the Netzarim corridor\".\n\"Reports of injured individuals as a result of IDF fire in the area were received. The details are under review,\" it stated.\nThe GHF said there were \"no incidents near any of our sites this morning\".\nParamedics and rescuers said that at least 25 people were also killed near a site run by the GHF in southern Gaza on Tuesday morning.\nA witness told the BBC that he had gone to a site north of Rafah at 05:00, but shortly before it was due to open at 10:00, Israeli tanks advanced towards them and opened fire with no announcements.\n\"The shooting was directly on the civilians and blood got everywhere,\" Hatem Abu Rjileh said.\n\"Everyone around us got wounded, there may be more than 30 wounded whom no-one was able to rescue. We only managed to rescue our relative and left with him.\"\nThe IDF told the BBC that \"contrary to the reports being spread out, the IDF is not aware of the incident in question at the Rafah aid distribution site\".\nIsrael eased its total blockade of Gaza just over a month ago, and the GHF began operations a few days later. The group says it has since provided 41 million meals.\nWhile GHF is officially classed as a private organisation, it has opaque funding and is backed by the US and Israel. It uses armed private security contractors.\nThe UN and major aid groups have refused to co-operate with the foundation, accusing it of co-operating with Israel's goals in the 20-month-old war against Hamas in a way that violates humanitarian principles.\nHowever, Israel sees the GHF as key to a new aid plan which it says will undermine what remains of Hamas control in Gaza.\nAs news of the latest incidents broke, a spokesman for the UN human rights office, Thameen al-Kheetan, held a briefing in Geneva condemning the system.\n\"Israel's militarised humanitarian assistance mechanism is in contradiction with international standards on aid distribution,\" he said.\n\"The weaponization of food for civilians, in addition to restricting or preventing their access to life-sustaining services constitutes a war crime.\"\nHe added that it was for courts to decide if war crimes had been committed.\nSpeaking to reporters in Berlin, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), said: \"The newly created, so-called mechanism is an abomination that humiliates and degrades desperate people. It is a death trap costing more lives than it saves.\"\nAsked for a response to recent UN criticism, the IDF told the BBC that it allowed the GHF \"to operate independently in distributing aid to the residents of Gaza and is working to ensure its safe and continuous distribution, in accordance with international law\".\nIsrael's idea for a new phase of war in Gaza, put forward several weeks ago, has not taken place.\nThis involved the GHF running the only aid distribution points.\nFor now, Israel is still allowing dozens of lorries carrying aid for the UN and some other aid organisations into Gaza.\nOn Saturday, World Central Kitchen said aid lorries had reached its teams in Gaza for the first time in over 12 weeks, allowing it to restart cooking at some of its sites.\nHowever, the volume of food is still inadequate, and experts warn that Gaza remains on the brink of famine.\nIn Gaza City, a father of four daughters told us that his family had resorted to eating bread and salt but that he would not risk his life to go to the GHF aid centres.\n\"They are called death zones,\" Mahmoud al-Ghura said. \"My son has already been martyred.\"\n\"I am afraid that if I went to get a bag of flour I would return carried in one. Every day people go there and die. What are we to do?\"",

            "content": "Israel began bombing Gaza on 7 October 2023, after Hamas crossed the border, killed approximately 1,200 people and took 251 others hostage to Gaza.\nWhen ground operations began a week later, most observers in Israel and beyond expected the fighting to last weeks. Instead, it extended for 15 monthsuntil Wednesday’s announcement of a ceasefire, to become Israel’s longest war since the 1948 conflict that led to the country’s creation.\nThe majority of those killed by militants on 7 October were civilians, and the scale and ferocity of the attack was unprecedented. So was the scale and ferocity of Israel’s response.\nAfter onebrief ceasefire and hostage release dealin November 2023, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to keep fighting, promising “total victory” over Hamas.\nThe impact of the campaign on civilians living in Gaza led to accusations of genocide, including from rights groups, scholars and foreign governments. South Africabrought a caseto the international court of justice.\nOmer Bartov, a former soldier in the Israel Defense Forces and historian of genocide,wrotethat by May 2024 “it was no longer possible to deny that Israel was engaged in systematic war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocidal actions”.\nThe UN Human Rights Officesaid in Novemberthat data on verified deaths indicates “an apparent indifference to the death of civilians and the impact of the means and methods of warfare”.\nEven Israel’s staunchest ally, the United States,restricted some weapons shipmentsover the concerns, and in September the UKsuspended some arms export licencesowing to Israel’s conduct of the war.\nNetanyahu and his former minister of defence Yoav Gallant have beenissued with arrest warrants by the international criminal courtfor alleged war crimes relating to the conflict. TheHamas military leader Mohammed Deifhas also been issued with an arrest warrant.\nBelow is a summary of the cost of the war forGazaand its people.\nMore than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed inside Gaza by Israeli attacks, according to health officials in the territory. Most of the dead are civilians, and the total represents about 2% of Gaza’s prewar population, or one in every 50.\nMore than 40,000 have been identified, including 13,319 child victims, theyoungest only a couple of hours old. The elderly dead include a 101-year-old great-great-grandfather.\nAnother 110,000 have been wounded, over a quarter of whom now live with life-changing injuries including amputations, major burns and head injuries.\nYet these figures do not tell the full story of Palestinian losses. The official count of the war dead includes only those killed by bombs and bullets, whose bodies have been recovered and buried.\nAbout 10,000 people killed by airstrikes are thought to be entombed in collapsed buildings, because of the lack of heavy equipment or fuel to dig through steel and concrete ruins looking for them.\nAstudy published this monthfound the official toll underestimated deaths from traumatic injuries in the first nine months of the war, failing to capture two in every five casualties. That would suggest that by October 2024 “the true mortality figures probably exceeded 70,000”, the authors wrote.\nHunger, lack of shelter and medication, the rapid spread of infectious diseases and the collapse of the healthcare system have killed many other Palestinians during the war. Authoritiesplan to count those dead when the fighting stops, Dr Marwan al-Hams, the director of field hospitals at the ministry of health, has said.\nIsraeli officials question the death toll given by the authorities in Gaza, arguing that because Hamas controls the government there, Gaza’s health officials cannot provide reliable figures.\nBut doctors and civil servants in the territory have acredible record from past wars. After several conflicts between 2009 and 2021, UN investigators drew up their own lists of the dead and found they closely matched ones from Gaza.\nIsrael’s campaign of intense aerial bombing and mass demolitions has levelled swathes of Gaza, and left whole neighbourhoods barely habitable.\nNine in 10 homes in the territory have been destroyed or damaged, thelatest UN figures show. Schools, hospitals, mosques, cemeteries, shops and offices have also been repeatedly hit.\nThe devastation is so intense that some experts say that the large-scale destruction of homes and the infrastructure of daily life should be recognised as anew war crime: “domicide”.\nEven where homes are still standing, many residents have been forced to leave. Eighty percent of Gaza’s territory was placed under evacuation orders that werestill active in late December.\nSome 1.9 million people have been displaced,90% of the population, with many of them forced to move repeatedly.\nHundreds of thousands now are living in tent cities and severely overcrowded shelters with poor sanitation and access to little clean water. Shelters have also been attacked.\nFor rebuilding to start, Gaza will need a staggering clean-up operation. The war has left over 40m tonnes of debris, in collapsed buildings that may be laced with explosives including boobytraps and unexploded bombs. It could take over a decade to remove, a top UN de-mining official warnedin spring.\nThe Israeli military says its fight is againstHamas and not Gaza, that its bombardment is proportional to threats and that it makes every effort to warn citizens of imminent attacks.\nAlmost every school building in Gaza has been damaged or destroyed, and none are in operation. Gaza’s 660,000 school-age children have not had any access to formal education for more than a year.\nThe war will set education back there by up to five years, and risks creating a lost generation of permanently traumatised youth,a studyby Cambridge academics and the UN found.\nThere were 564 school buildings in Gaza on 7 October 2023. Of these, 534 have been damaged or destroyed and 12 are classified as “possible damage”. The status of the remaining 18 schools is “currently not known”, Unicef said in anOctober report.\nSchools run by the Unrwa agency for Palestinian schools have been converted into emergency shelters. They host large numbers of displaced people and are clearly marked on maps, but many have been bombed, with sometargeted multiple times.\nIsrael says strikes targetedHamasfighters, claiming they shelter in the buildings and use civilian residents as human shields.\nIsraeli forces repeatedly bombed, besieged and attacked hospitals in Gaza throughout the war. Medics were killed, injured, detained and tortured.\nThere were 654 attacks on health facilitiesrecordedsince the start of the war, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in January 2025.\nOver 1,050 healthcare workers, including nurses, paramedics, doctors, and other medical personnel were killed, many in their place of work. Dozens of others were detained, and at least threedied in Israeli custody.\nAt the end of 2024, just 17 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals were even partially functional. Services were boosted by 11 field hospitals, but Israeli controls on the entry of aid and relief workers meant these wereoften short of doctors and medical supplies.\nA UN commission concluded that Israel’s “relentless and deliberate attacks on medical personnel and facilities” constituted war crimes.\nThey amounted to “a concerted policy to destroy Gaza’s healthcare system as part of a broader assault on Gaza”, the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territoryfound.\nThe lack of hospitals, healthcare staff and medication compounded the suffering of people injured in the war, and suffering from diseases caused or compounded by lack of shelter, food and clean water.\nIn 2024, more than 1.2 million respiratory infections were recorded, along with 570,000 cases of acute diarrhoea,UN figures showed.\nIsraeli controls on aid entering Gaza, and the destruction of agricultural production inside the territory, led to widespread hunger and malnutrition.\nIn November 2024, the UN said aid and commercial shipments into Gaza were at thelowest levelssince October 2023, and an international watchdog said faminewas likely “imminent”in the northern Gaza Strip.\nIn January the UNsaid96% of children under two years old and women in Gaza were not getting their required nutrients, 345,000 people faced catastrophic food shortages, and 876,000 faced emergency levels of food insecurity.\nMalnutrition in pregnancy and childhood stunts mental and physical development, so many children who survived the war will endure lifelong impacts from food shortages.\nIsrael said it did not limit aid shipments and blamed logistics failures at aid agencies, or Hamas theft of food aid, for any shortages.\nAt least half Gaza’s tree coverhas been razed, soil and water have been contaminated and there is huge damage to agricultural land. The destruction will have long-term impacts on ecosystems, biodiversity, food security and the health of residents, ecologists and academics say.\nSome damage has come directly from Israeli attacks on farms and other infrastructure.\nBy March this year, approximately 40% of the land in Gaza previously used for food productionhad been destroyed, an investigation by Forensic Architecture found. Satellite analysisrevealed to the Guardianshows farms devastated and nearly half of the territory’s trees razed.\nThe Israeli military damaged or destroyed least 31 of 54 water reservoirs by late August, Human Rights Watchfound. Toxic residue from munitions and fires have polluted both soil and water supplies.\nOther forms of damage have been indirect. When Israel cut off fuel, electricity and chemical supplies within the first week of the war, all wastewater treatment and most sewage pumping plants were forced to shut down, leading to sewage overflows into the sea and groundwater.\nAmid widespread aid shortages Gaza’s hungry and freezing residents have also burned toxic plastics and cut down trees to use the wood for fuel and cooking.\nPalestinians reported buried under rubble in Gaza:11,000\nPalestinians displaced in Gaza:1.9 million(90% of the population)\nAttacks on healthcare facilities during the war:654\nChildren out of formal education:660,000(all school-age children)\nPeople killed inside Israel on 7 October 2023: about1,200\nPeople abducted to Gaza from Israel on 7 October 2023:251\nHostages still in Gaza in January 2025:101(37 believed dead)",

            "content": "George Mitchell, the great US advocate for the Northern Ireland peace agreement, described diplomacy as 700 days of failure and one of success. InGaza, tragically, there have been 730 days of failure and none of success. Indeed, the destruction, the death toll and the spillover of the conflict into other countries is a monument to shame diplomacy and what remains of international law. Arguably, it is the profession’s lowest point since 1939.\nSome will claim failure is inevitable since this conflict is now so embedded and impervious to compromise that it can only be settled at the barrel of the gun, in essence through the repression or erasure of one side.\nYet, however entrenched the mutual hatreds, a consensus is building across the west that this conflict was desperately mishandled, including by European leaders who initially ceded responsibility to a US Democratic administration that romanticised modernIsrael, misread how its government might react to the horror of 7 October – and how that would polarise the west.\nIndeed, the mea culpas and self-justifications have been streaming out of Joe Biden’s former team. In her book on her doomed bid to become president, Kamala Harris writes: “I had pleaded with Joe, when he spoke publicly on this issue, to extend the same empathy he showed to the suffering of Ukrainians to the suffering of innocent Gazan civilians. But he couldn’t do it: while he could passionately state ‘I am a Zionist’, his remarks about innocent Palestinians came off as inadequate and forced.”\nShe adds that Benjamin Netanyahu never repaid the loyalty that Biden had shown because he wanted Donald Trump in the seat opposite him.\nAt its most generous, the Democrats misread the power dynamics. “We did not act like a superpower,” Andrew Miller, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Israeli-Palestinian affairs, said recently. “Instead of beginning from the proposition that these were problems we could solve, we persuaded ourselves that there was little we could do to move our regional ally Israel.”\nTrump did not have that inferiority complex. He used his unpredictability as his greatest diplomatic weapon but, like Biden, his special envoy Steve Witkoff became bogged down in trying to find a formula that guaranteed the release of all the hostages without Israelresuming the fighting, as it did in March this year.\nAs successive variations of the Witkoff proposals emerged, France and Saudi Arabia took matters into their own hands, deciding to use a UN conference on a two-state solution as a vehicle for gripping the diplomacy in a different way. The US monopoly on the peace process was broken and the neglected issue of Palestinian self-rule was finally addressed.\nBefore the conference, initially due to be held in June but delayed by a month by Israel’s attack on Iran, Emmanuel Macron extracted a letter from the Palestinian Authority (PA) president, Mahmoud Abbas, that endorsed a plan for the day after a ceasefire under which Hamas would be disarmed and debarred from holding office and a transitional body of experts would be formed to governPalestine“under the umbrella” of a reformed Palestinian Authority. The notion of reform of the PA, often an empty diplomatic vessel, was this time given specifics, including a commitment by Abbas to much-delayed elections and internal change. An international force would be introduced.\nMany versions of the “day after” plan for Gaza had been circulating since 2024 – one by American and Israeli experts published by the Wilson Center, another drafted by the Rand Corporation, a set of principles issued by the United Arab Emirates and a plan from Egypt. The Saudi-French plan incorporated many of these ideas into what became the New York declaration, passed by the UN conference in July andendorsed by the UN general assemblyin September, with Israel and the US voting against.\nOne European diplomat said: “Although there was a lot of media heat about the issue ofrecognising Palestinian statehood, that was not where the serious diplomatic breakthrough was. We managed to convince the Americans to link the commitments to the ceasefire to a plan for what happens afterwards – and to realise that focusing on a ceasefire on its own would not work.”\nIn reference to the US’s over-reliance on Israeli firepower to impose its will, the diplomat said: “We also convinced them they could not go on rolling the dice and thinking it will come up double six.”\nCritical to the process was a meeting in the White House in late August where Jared Kushner, Tony Blair and Witkoff convinced Trump thatmass expulsions of Palestiniansfrom Gaza was neither necessary nor wise.\nOne of those present said: “Trump had no illusions about Netanyahu’s reliability and had invested in the Middle East states. He was persuaded that for states such as Jordan and Egypt the spectre of waves of Palestinian refugees spilling over their borders was a red line. Trump agreed to take mass enforced displacement off the agenda.”\nThe other big message out of the meeting was that for the first time it became feasible to try to merge White House and French thinking. Speaking at Harvard University last month, the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said: “President Trump asked some of his close advisers to go to the Arab countries, to go to France, to go to the UK, to gather all the ideas that all of us have been putting together for months and years for what a day after plan would look like.”\nThe aim of the two-state solution conference and the general assembly vote, Barrot said, was to remove the obstacles to the two-state solution, including by Arab states condemning the 7 October attacks and endorsing the declaration’s exclusion ofHamasfrom Gaza.\n“Until that vote, there was no international condemnation of Hamas, no international call for its disarmament, no international goal for its exclusion from any future role in the governance of Gaza and Palestine,” Barrot said. “This is done. We have changed the mindset. Everyone now sees Hamas for what they are: a terrorist organisation.”\nThe second obstacle, he explained, was to overcome Arab governments’ reluctance to state publicly that they had a goal of establishing diplomatic relations with Israel.\nBarrot said the new UN text went further than ever before. “We got them … to say that they aspire not only to have a normal relationship with Israel, but to enter into a common regional architecture in the model of Asean in Asia or OSCE in Europe,” he said. “We got them to say things they never said.”\nSo, contrary to appearance, the weeks and days leading up to the general assembly was about the Arab states reaching out to Israel. Far from being rewarded, Hamas, an opponent of a two-state solution, was being ostracised from political power in Palestine, a fate its battered leadership has reluctantly accepted.\nBut for Israel the New York declaration, with its clear references to a Palestinian state and a role for a reformed Palestinian Authority, remained unacceptable. So when Trump revealed his plan to the Arab and Muslim states on the sidelines of the general assembly, the declaration had become the benchmark against which it was to be judged by the Arab and Muslim states.\nThe Trump plan, largely prepared by Blair and Kushner, was necessarilythin, ambiguousand stripped of a timetable. The Arab states had misgivings, but advocates such as Blair argued that if the plan was more specific it would lose the required broad support and critical momentum. The lack of immediate leaks delighted western diplomats since it suggested the Arab states thought they could work with the plan.\nBut while the Arab states left New York, Netanyahu stayed in New York, holding two lengthy weekend meetings with Witkoff. After Israel’sattack on Hamas negotiatorsin Qatar on 9 September – a personal betrayal of Witkoff and Qatar – Netanyahu was persona non grata in the White House. Yet the Israeli prime minister extracted further concessions.\nThe amnesty to Hamas members was only available to those who handed over weapons in front of international observers and committed to peaceful coexistence. More detail was added about the destruction of Hamas infrastructure. Moreover, the withdrawal of Israel Defense Forces was blurred, and by the end the IDF would have to withdraw only to a security buffer zone encompassing more than 17% of Gaza until the strip “is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”.\nThe process for this withdrawal “will be carried out according to criteria, and with a timeframe, to be agreed upon between the IDF, the international stabilisation force, the guarantors and the United States”.\nAfter the plan’s publication, Netanyahu in a video message assured his domestic audience that Israel’s red lines were protected: Gaza separated from the West Bank, no return by the PA to Gaza, no path toward a “two-state solution” and no removal of Israel security forces from the majority of the Gaza Strip.\nIn trying to assuage the extremists in his coalition, Netanyahu was also doing all he could to persuade Hamas to reject the plan, so he could pursue the military offensive into Gaza City.\nEven though the plan did not have a timeline for when the board of technocrats would hand power to an elected Palestinian government, Qatar, Turkey and Egypt urged Hamas to accept many of the unsatisfactory ambiguities that could be addressed later. The war would end.\nDiplomats said this message was received best not by the Hamas political wing in Doha but by the Hamas fighters inside Gaza, a new younger cadre steeped in the sacrifices made. With wording crafted by Qatar, the Hamas answer was in effect a “yes, but” that was open to many interpretations. Trump, to Netanyahu’s utter dismay, chose to take the Hamas response as an unqualified “yes”. The key was that Hamas was willing to relinquish its greatest bargaining chip: the remaining hostages.\nTahani Mustafa, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, argues that since the 7 October attack Palestinian politics has shifted to a more transactional outlook. “Palestinians are looking to someone that can make life bearable, keep them on their land and improve their living conditions. The very bare minimum is what people are asking for. Most Palestinians on the ground have resigned themselves to their fate.”\nOn this basis, the technocratic body to be chaired by Trump, but likely to be dominated by Blair with some figures from the Palestinian diaspora, could derive its legitimacy through its effectiveness.\nBlair will be working against the destabilising backdrop of imminent elections in both Israel and Palestine. One of the body’s first tasks will be to build a relationship with Palestinian politics. Blair has close relations with the elites of the Middle East but none with the street, and he may leave to others such as Egypt the task of mediating an intra-Palestinian dialogue on Palestinian unity, a dialogue led by China, that the ageing and authoritarian PA president has sought to sabotage.\nIf elections do occur as promised, it could produce a change. The last time elections were attempted, in 2021 in the West Bank, the democratic appetite was there with 36 lists formed outside the established factions. The key question is what will happen if the elections produce a result that Blair’s technocratic board do not like.\nAs the Gaza war has continued with ever worsening devastation, Israel’s reputation has been shattered. In the Arab world, Israel is now seen as a greater threat to security than Iran. In the global south it is likened to apartheid South Africa, and across Europe the demonstrations and accusations of genocide continue. Growing majorities of American Jews and Democrats disapprove of Israel’s actions.\nRobert Malley, a US negotiator at the time of the Oslo accords, has just co-authored a book on the impossibility of rational diplomatic answers to the conflict. He said external would-be peacemakers had been “so focused on whether we can get them to agree on what it would mean if there was a Palestinian state, just words on a piece of paper, without coming to terms with the nature of this conflict, the nature of this beast – which was a historical clash of narratives.\n“From the Israeli perspective, they won in 1948. They won in 1967. And the Palestinians believe that they were victims of a historic injustice in 1948, 700,000 Palestinians expelled, loss of their land.\n“And so for us Americans to come in and say, ‘well, let’s just paper over these differences, forget about the right of return, forget about Israeli historic grievances and Palestinian historic grievances, put a bow around it and call this peace’ – that was never going to fly with the parties.”",

            "content": "If Ramallah has a center, it is Al-Manara Square. Six roads meet here, and pedestrians weave their way confidently across the tight roundabout, forcing cars to make way. It is always busy.\nDemonstrators will rally here to protest, but when CNN visited on a Sunday morning, people were going about their business. All the same, photos from the war inGazaposted in the square and hung on banners and fences remind anyone who needs reminding of the horrors unfolding not far away.\n“This destruction resembles the conscience of the world,” reads one poster, under a picture of rescue workers clearing rubble.\nAnother photograph shows ambulances outside a hospital with the text, “Medical Heroes demand action: Stop the Massacre in Gaza!”\nAt his office about a mile away, where desks and shelves groan under piles of paperwork, Khalil Shikaki is thinking about the conflict.\nPalestinians, he says, overwhelmingly support the Hamas decision to go to war with Israel.\nNetanyahu’s mission: Destroy Hamas, bring hostages home – and get reelected\nHis research company, the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR), has just published the findings of its latest survey into Palestinian attitudes.\nSeven hundred and fifty adults were interviewed face to face in the West Bank, and 481 were interviewed in Gaza, also in person. The Gaza data collection was done during the recent truce, when it was safer for researchers to move about.\nThe survey, which has a four-point margin of error (rather than the usual three-point), found that almost three-quarters (72%) of all respondents believe Hamas’s decision to launch its attack on Israel on October 7 was “correct.”\nBut that doesn’t mean support for atrocities, he adds. “No one should see this as support for any atrocities that might have been committed by Hamas on that day.”\n“Palestinians believe that diplomacy and negotiations are not an option available to them, that only violence and armed struggle is the means to end the siege and blockade over Gaza, and in general to end the Israeli occupation,” Shikaki said.\nThis important distinction is teased out by three of the poll’s data points. Almost 80% of respondents told PCPSR researchers that killing women and children in their homes is a war crime.\nAn even higher number (85%) of respondents said they had not watched videos shown by international news outlets of acts committed by Hamas on October 7 – a figure which may hint at why only 10% of those surveyed said they believed Hamas had committed war crimes that day.\nTo a considerable extent, Palestinians, just like Israelis, are getting a skewed perspective from their media. In addition to this bubble effect, Shikaki says, there might also be a desire to avoid other sources to maintain deniability. Denial, as he says, is useful during periods of stress and pain.\nPolling in a war zone comes with difficulties even in the lulls. Interviewing people in the center and south of the enclave was relatively straightforward as most were still at home, but surveying people from the north of Gaza was partially compromised because so many had been displaced to shelters.\nGaza and the West Bank, what are now called the Palestinian territories, have been geographically separated since 1948. Recent decades have seen that separation take root between the two populations, not least because it has become harder and harder for Palestinians to move between the territories.\nSince 2005, when Israel moved its soldiers and settlers out of Gaza and essentially sealed off the territory with help from Egypt, the day-to-day experiences of Palestinians in Gaza have diverged even further from those ofPalestinians in the West Bank.\nPolitically, the territories are split. The Palestinian Authority under aging President Mahmoud Abbas has partial control over the West Bank, while Hamas controls what goes on inside Gaza – or it did until Israel invaded.\nThese differences are reflected across the attitudes surveyed, in particular, on the use of violence.\nIn Gaza, support for armed struggle has risen only slightly from 50% in September 2022 (a year before the current war) to 56% in December 2023. In the West Bank, however, support has been rising dramatically from 35% in September 2022 to 54% in September 2023 (a month before the war). This month, polled support for armed struggle reached 68% in the West Bank.\nShikaki says these divergences reflect the rise in attacks by violent Jewish settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank, which have drawn condemnation from the US and Europe, along with the pervasive sense that Israel’s current hard-right government is not overly perturbed by that state of affairs.\nRelease of Palestinian prisoners sheds light on controversial Israeli justice system in the occupied West Bank\nHamas, unsurprisingly perhaps, finds growing support, especially among West Bank Palestinians. Backing for the militant group as a political party has increased there nearly four-fold (from 12% to 44%) in the three months between September 2023 and December 2023.\nIn besieged Gaza, by contrast, support has remained relatively stable with 38% support in September and 42% in December.\nFatah, the secular-nationalist party of Palestinian Authority (PA) President Abbas, which led the Palestine Liberation Organization to its historic agreements with Israel in the 1990s — which created the PA but crucially did not get around to solving some of the conflict’s most fundamental issues — has seen its support fall across the territories from 26% three months ago to 17% now.\nSupport for Abbas himself is even lower – so low, in fact, that he is seen as almost entirely discredited.\nBut Shikaki cautions that higher support for Hamas should not be over-stated, at least not yet. As more Palestinians come to terms with the atrocities committed by Hamas on October 7, so attitudes could change — though that is unlikely to be the case so long as Gaza remains under massive attack.\nImportant again is how many people have watched videos from October 7 and the differences between the territories. In Gaza, 25% of those asked said they had viewed such videos; and 16% of all respondents told researchers Hamas had committed war crimes. In the West Bank, the corresponding numbers were just 7% and 1%.\nGaza is moving out of denial more quickly than the West Bank, Shikaki says, and that means a reckoning for Hamas. Already, only 38% of Gazans want to see the militant group return to governance after the war.\nBut it is not just greater awareness of events on a single day that matter. It is also what happens when politics resumes when the war is over, and whether Palestinians see any sort of political horizon.\nAt a time when people believe the only way to get Israel to end the occupation is by inflicting pain and suffering on Israelis, Palestinians see Hamas as the party most capable of delivering violence effectively, Shikaki says.\nOn the other hand, “if and when you give the Palestinians the option of negotiating a permanent end to Israeli occupation and the creation of a Palestinian state … support for Hamas will probably decline to below where it was before the war,” he says.\nSupport for the two-state solution has remained largely stable across Gaza and the West Bank over the past three months, moving from 32% to 34%, but historically, those figures are still low. In the past, PCPSR polling has shown support for the existence of an independent Palestine sitting next to the state of Israel at between 70% and 80%.\nUS President Joe Biden has sought to convince both Israelis and the Palestinians that ﻿he sees negotiations as important, saying last month, “I don’t think (the conflict) ultimately ends until there is a two-state solution.” The problem is, Palestinians do not seem to believe him. Nearly three-quarters (70%) of respondents said they do not regard US talk about Palestinian statehood as serious.\n“Since you have all that power, people are not going to believe you if you say, well, I can’t use leverage against Israel. So, the conclusion is you are paying lip service to the two-state solution, but you have absolutely no intention of doing anything to make it a reality.”",

            "content": "It’s a long and dangerous walk to the point through which trucks carryingaid into Gazaare expected to pass. Um Khader and other women who live in the tents neighboring hers are huddled next to a car in the dark, surrounded by a large crowd of men.\nNot many women can be seen around the bonfires dotting the horizon near Gaza City on this night in June, captured on video. The sole providers for their children, this group of mothers sticks together for protection. The most dangerous part of their journey is yet to start.\nThey could come under Israeli fire and, once the aid trucks arrive, they will have to jostle their way through thousands of men if they hope to get their hands on a bag of flour and keep it.\n“Everything around us is a risk to our lives, whether it’s thieves, Israeli soldiers, rockets or drones. Everything,” says Um Khader, a mother of three.\n‘Worst-case scenario of famine’ is unfolding in Gaza, UN-backed food security initiative says\nHer friend Walaa recounts what happened the previous day, when she managed to get a bag of flour after waiting 10 hours from dawn to dusk. “Then a young man with a knife said, ‘drop the flour or I’ll kill you,’” she says. She handed it over.\nTheir feet are aching and they had to take frequent rests on the up to 2-hour walk to the spot where the aid trucks might pass. Their friend Maryam gave birth just three weeks earlier but she’s been doing the same journey every day for the past week, hoping to secure food for her three older children. There’s little hope of formula to help feed her newborn.\nThat night ended in disappointment. No aid trucks passed through, and they all went back empty-handed.\nThe trickle of aid allowed into Gaza, the breakdown of law and order and the dismantling of United Nations-led delivery systems have created new levels of desperation, according to aid groups. The fittest struggle to survive and the most vulnerable are left with nothing.\nOver the course of several weeks in June and July, CNN followed a group of Palestinian women facing an awful choice between risking their own lives, which could deprive their families of their only remaining provider, or watching their children starve.\n“My children tell me: ‘Don’t go, Mama, don’t go to the aid centers, we don’t want you to die, Mama. Who will take care of us if something happens to you?” Um El-Abed said. Her husband was killed in an Israeli airstrike and she is now caring for her family alone, she told CNN.\nThe pot of soup she could secure from a crowded charity kitchen was hardly enough for her eight hungry children. So, like many Palestinians in Gaza, Um El-Abed eventually tried her luck with aid trucks, making the trek at night while her children slept. And, like most of the women on that route, she came back empty-handed, she said.\n‘The weak treating the weak’: Doctors in Gaza are fainting while trying to save their starving patients\nThe threat facing their children is real. Famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption levels in most of the Gaza Strip and for acute malnutrition rates in Gaza City, where the women live,accordingto the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.\nSixty-three people have died of starvation in July alone, including 25 children, all but one of those aged under 5, according to the World Health Organization. Over 11,500 children sought treatment for malnutrition in Gaza’s barely functioning hospitals and clinics in June and July, theUN agency saidSunday. Nearly one in five of them had severe acute malnutrition, the most life-threatening form, it added.\nThe crisis is also exacting a heavy toll on pregnant and breastfeeding women, WHO said, with recent data showing that over 40% were severely malnourished.\nIsrael announced over the weekend that it would pausefighting in certain areasand establish corridors for humanitarian deliveries on the ground. But far too little food is making its way in to meet the needs of Gaza’s 2.2 million people, thrust into a crisis that the United Kingdom, France and Germany last week described as“man-made and avoidable.”\nIsrael imposed an 11-week blockade on all aid into the strip beginning in March, finally restarting distribution in late May through the controversial US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).\nInstead of the 400 aid distribution points the UN managed in the past, Palestinians can only get food through four GHF sites, at over-crowded soup kitchens, or by stopping and overpowering aid trucks as they drive through the territory. Looted sacks of flour are sold in the market for exorbitant prices, unaffordable for these women and their children.\nAfter numerous failed attempts in June to get food from aid trucks, Um Khader received a donation from a sympathetic stranger along the way. She shared the bag of flour with her neighbor Um Bilal, who was struggling to feed her five children.\nTheir friendship and camaraderie hit a rare tender note in a cacophony of suffering. The screams of their hungry children are often unbearable. Um Bilal said her youngest daughter sometimes pulls her hair out as she screams in pain.\nBoth women said they often go without food for days on end so that their children can have every single drop of the soup they get, yet the children always go to sleep hungry.\nOver the weeks, their desperation has deepened. They decided to try their luck at the GHF distribution sites, where the majority of the 1,100 aid-related killings have occurred since May, according to the UN and the Palestinian health ministry. Israel admits to firing warning shots but denies responsibility for the heavy death toll, while the GHF rebuffs accusations, saying the statistics are exaggerated.\n“The American aid points are death zones. I reached one and spent the night there. A sniper fired above my head. The bullet missed me by mere centimeters,” Um Khader recalled as the two women spoke to CNN on Friday. She hasn’t gone back since.\nShe dissolves salt in water to give her children between their sporadic meals. This isn’t the first time she’s experienced hunger during the war that has followed the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks. “We used to eat animal feed. A year ago, our bodies could handle it, but now, it’s famine on top of famine, our bodies can’t take it anymore,” she said. Now she has become too weak to make those long treks.\nUm Bilal is unrelenting. She has come across tanks, dodged gunfire, and fainted from sunstrokes and fatigue as she’s tried to get food from moving UN trucks or at GHF sites. But her desperate efforts to feed her children often go unrewarded.\n“My mother is not like the young men, she goes and comes back empty-handed,” her 10-year-old daughter Dalia said. “She asks me what we’ll eat for lunch or dinner, and I tell her ‘it’s okay, don’t cry, Mom.’”",

            "content": "The bright pink jumper with a picture of Cinderella hangs off Jana’s skinny shoulders as she walks through the northern Gaza moonscape, piles of rubble, dirt and dust all around her. Clutching a large tub in her hand, the 12-year-old is on a mission: find food and water.\nJana Mohammed Khalil Musleh Al-Skeifi and her family say she has been responsible for getting supplies for them all since an Israeli sniper killed her older brother more than a year ago. Her parents are in poor health, so it now falls on her to provide for them.\n“I don’t want my father to get tired. That’s why I’m strong. I want to be strong, so my father doesn’t suffer,” Jana told CNN while waiting in a queue at a water distribution spot in Gaza City. “My father is elderly and has heart disease. If he tries to carry the bucket, he’ll fall.”\nRelated articleUK, France, Canada threaten sanctions if Israel continues new offensive into Gaza.\nSparing her father the strenuous work, the slight girl carried two heavy buckets full of water all the way home, the knuckles of her fingers turned white from the heavy load, jeans soaked from the precious water sloshing about.\nFinding food and water became difficult after Israel launched its brutal war in Gaza following the October 7 terror attack by Hamas and its allies. But the situation has becomecatastrophicsince Israel imposed a total blockade on all aid more than 11 weeks ago.\nA United Nations-backed report published earlier this month said that one in five people in Gaza arefacing starvationas the territory, home to 2.1 million people, edges closer to man-made famine.\nIsrael said the blockade, along with a new military campaign, is intended to pressure Hamas to release hostages held in the enclave. But many international organizations have accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war.\nGetting clean water has been difficult for months because Israel restricts access to water treatment and desalination equipment, claiming that these items can be used to manufacture weapons.\nDoctors without Borders, the humanitarian organization, said that more than two-thirds of the 1,700 water and sanitation items it sought to deliver to Gaza between January 2024 and early March 2025 were rejected by Israeli authorities.\n“You can barely fill one bucket, because there’s no proper queuing system, and if you wait, you might not get anything. Sometimes we have to go without,” Jana said.\n“I sit there for hours just waiting to fill one bucket. It’s an awful feeling.”\nThe family told CNN it has resorted to using salt water to clean and cook in the past.\nThe Israeli military announced Sunday it would allow a “basic amount of food” to enter Gaza as it launched its new major offensive in the strip. The reason, the military said, was the fact that a “starvation crisis” in Gaza would “jeopardize the operation.”\nThe following day, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated Israel had taken the step because itsWestern allies, including the United States, were threatening to withdraw their support for the country if it allowed Gaza to descend into a famine.\nBut only five trucks were allowed in on Monday, when humanitarian organizations said 500 a day were required just to feed those who need it the most. UN aid chief Tom Fletcher described the delivery as a “drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed.”\nThe hunger is becoming catastrophic. The Ministry of Health in Gaza said that at least 57 children have died from the effects of malnutrition since the start of the war.\nJana’s baby niece Janat was one of them, her family says.\nWhile Janat was born small, weighing just 2.6 kilograms (5 lb 12 oz), her mother Aya told CNN the baby girl was growing and putting on weight. She became a healthy baby, reaching a weight of around 4 kilograms (8 lb 13 oz). She learned to smile, she was alert.\nOn March 2, Israel imposed its total blockade on Gaza, preventing even the most basic supplies, including baby formula and medicines, from entering the strip.\nAya said that when food became scarce, she began to struggle to breastfeed Janat, who started to lose weight. The baby developed chronic diarrhea, became dehydrated and was soon so poorly that she needed medical attention.\n“(At the hospital) they said there was a special medical milk that would help her gain weight and stop the diarrhea — but we couldn’t find it. We searched all over Gaza, hospital by hospital, pharmacy by pharmacy. Even the Ministry of Health told us it wasn’t available,” Aya told CNN.\nA CNN video of Janat from mid-April shows the tiny baby wrapped up and held tightly by Aya. Her tiny face is all bones beneath the skin, and she looks more like a newborn than a four-month-old. Her skinny, long fingers are poking out of the blanket, and she looks sleepy. Her big brown eyes are the only part of her exhausted body that seem able to move, her gaze following people as they move around her.\nAt the same time, Janat’s mother was struggling too, weakened by the lack of food and clean water. Like many new mothers in Gaza in these conditions, she lost her milk – leaving her unable to feed her baby. The UN-backed hunger report said that almost 11,000 pregnant women in Gaza are already at risk of famine, and nearly 17,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women will need urgent treatment for acute malnutrition over the coming months.\nJanat kept deteriorating. Her mother told CNN the baby began to struggle to maintain her body temperature and doctors said her blood sugar level was dangerously low. Her oxygen levels were dropping. The malnutrition caused her kidneys and liver to malfunction and her blood became acidic as a result.\n“I pleaded to the whole world to save her. I just wanted someone to save her, to provide the milk she needed. But no one could help. Everyone was just watching,” Janat’s mother said.\nJanat’s mother told CNN that doctors at the hospital had recommended Janat for medical evacuation abroad. The family even managed to obtain the necessary paperwork, including a referral and a permit for Janat to leave.\nBut the baby girl died on May 4, before that was possible. At four months old, she was only 2.8 kilograms (6 lb 3 oz), barely more than her birth weight.\nMedical evacuations from Gaza have been extremely rare, even more so since Israel restarted military operations after the collapse of the ceasefire in March.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said last week that some 12,000 patients in Gaza need medical evacuation, and that only 123 people have been evacuated since hostilities restarted in March.\nFollowing the publication of this article, Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the government agency which manages the flow of aid into Gaza, told CNN that “nearly 800 patients in need of continued medical treatment outside the Gaza Strip” were evacuated since March, including during the ceasefire which ended on March 18.\nFlicking through photos of Janat, the day after the baby’s death, Jana became teary and upset. “They told us she couldn’t be treated unless she traveled abroad. We waited, they kept saying ‘Saturday’ and ‘Sunday,’ we waited until she died,” Jana said.\nAfter 18 months of war, every aspect of Jana’s life is filled with hardship.\nShe has too little food to eat and water to drink, no school to go to, no safe space to sleep. There is no electricity and the place she calls home is a half-destroyed house in Gaza City. Its walls are charred black from fire.\nJana used to live in a house where water came from a tap and light appeared with the flick of a switch. There was food, there was school, there was a dance performance during which she and her friends got to be the center of attention, wearing matching outfits and dancing as everyone clapped along.\nA family video from the event looks like any other taken by proud parents of a child performing in public. It’s a bit shaky, zoomed in on Jana as she hops around.\nWatching it amid the destruction, surrounded by bombed-out homes and piles of rubble, the footage looks like it came from a different universe.\n“I have no one left. I feel like I’ve died,” the 12-year-old told CNN, tears rolling down her cheeks. “Emotionally, I’m dead.”\nJana’s large family has been decimated by the war. She has lost a brother, a brother-in-law, a cousin and a niece, and is terrified of losing her mother who has thyroid cancer that cannot currently be treated in Gaza.\nAccording to the Gaza Ministry of Health, more than 53,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war over the past 18 months, roughly 4% of the strip’s population. This means that out of every 40 people living in Gaza before the war, one is now dead.\nBut there is little time to grieve for them when survival takes so much effort.\nOn May 12, the day before CNN last met with Jana,  she managed to find food to buy: 500 grams of pasta for 50 shekels ($15).\nLike many families in Gaza, they ground the pasta into flour to make bread, an attempt to make it last longer. Gaza has long since run out of flour.\nThe next day, when a nearby community kitchen gets supplies, a large crowd of hungry children assembles within minutes.\nThey watch the workers’ every move, eagerly awaiting the moment when the food is ready.\nIt is clear there isn’t enough for everyone, so the children jockey for the best spot, stretching their arms to get their pot as close as they can to the front, desperately trying to get the attention of those distributing the meals. Some are screaming and crying.\nJana is lucky. Two scoops of pasta with watery tomato sauce land in her tub. She looks exhausted and hungry, but happy.\nAs she walks home with the tub of steaming food, she does not touch it. Not until she gets home where her hungry siblings, nieces and nephews await.\nOnly then, sharing it with them, does Jana allow herself to tuck in.\nThis report has been updated with a statement from Israel on the number of medical evacuations from Gaza.\nTareq Al Hilou reported from Gaza, Abeer Salman reported from Jerusalem and Ivana Kottasová reported and wrote from London.

How many innocent babies like Zeinab should be starved to death so the world wakes up?” she asked.\nZeinab “died from complications of severe malnutrition,” said Dr. Munir al-Boursh, Director General of the Ministry of Health, in a post on X.\n“She was left to waste away until she became skin over bones…Over 260,000 children under the age of five in Gaza are suffering from malnutrition,” al-Boursh said.\nThe health ministry said Friday that 122 people had died from malnutrition in Gaza since the conflict began in 2023, including 83 children.\nGaza is starving and outrage is spreading. Will Netanyahu listen?\nThe majority of those deaths have occurred since early March, when Israel refused to allow aid deliveries into Gaza to continue. Although the ban was partially lifted in late May, aid agencies say the volume of aid being distributed is nowhere near what Gaza needs and malnutrition has spread.\nThe NGO Doctors Without Borders said that a quarter of children aged 6 months to 5-years-old and pregnant or breastfeeding women screened last week at its Gaza facilities were malnourished. It said the number of people it was treating for malnutrition has quadrupled since May 18.",

            "content": "Mimicking the motion of combing locks of hair with a brush, Sama Tubail stares at her reflection in a mirror and begins to cry.\n“I’m just so sad there isn’t a single strand of hair to comb with my brush,” Sama told CNN with her head in her hands. “I hold the mirror because I want to brush my hair: I really want to brush my hair again.”\nFor the eight-year-old, the movement brings back memories of a life before October 7, 2023 – when she had long hair and played outside with her friends in northern Gaza’s Jabalya. But since then, Sama and her family have been among the estimated1.9 million Palestiniansforcibly displaced from their homes, fleeing first to the enclave’s southern Rafah region underIsraeli military orders. As the violence escalated, Sama moved to a displacement camp in central Gaza’s Khan Younis.\nIsrael launched a war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people – mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities, and kidnapping more than 250. Israel’s military offensive, paused for almost two months under a fragile ceasefire deal, has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry.\nUNICEF, the United Nations’ children’s agency,estimatedin a report last June that nearly all of Gaza’s 1.2 million children need psychological support, especially those exposed to repeated traumatic events.\nA week after the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was announced in January, the UN’s humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, told theUN Security Councilthat “a generation has been traumatized.”\n“Children have been killed, starved and frozen to death,” Fletcher said, adding that “some died before their first breath – perishing with their mothers in childbirth.”\nIsraellaunched a fresh barrage of airstrikesearly Tuesday, shattering the ceasefire and killing hundreds of Palestinians, health officials in Gaza said. A doctor told CNN the scenes at one Gaza City hospital were “nothing close to anything I’ve experienced before” and thatthe majority of cases she had seen were children.\nCNN’s interviews with the families and experts featured in this article were conducted before the resumption of violence.\nLast year, doctors diagnosed that Sama’s hair loss was a result of “nervous shock,” specifically after her neighbor’s house in Rafah was hit by an Israeli airstrike in August.  The traumatic upending of her daily life since October 7 also likely contributed to her alopecia, a condition that causes hair loss, they said.\nA report late last year by theWar Child Alliance and Gaza-based Community Training Centre for Crisis Managementhighlights the severe psychological toll on children of Israel’s onslaught in Gaza over the past year. The report, based on a survey of more than 500 caregivers of vulnerable children, found that 96% of children in those circumstances felt that death was imminent and nearly half – 49% – had expressed a “wish to die” because of Israel’s assault.\nSama’s mental anguish intensified after she was bullied by other children for her hair loss, leading her to retreat indoors. Outside, she wears a pink bandana to cover her scalp.\n“Mama I’m tired – I want to die. Why won’t my hair grow?” she pleaded with her mother, Om-Mohammed, when CNN visited the family in September 2024, before asking if she would remain bald forever.\n“I want to die and have my hair grow in Paradise; God willing.”\nWith the tenuous ceasefire in place,tens of thousands of displaced Palestiniansstarted moving back home toward northern Gaza. Sama’s house was flattened in Israel’s bombardment and she and her family remained in Khan Younis, unable to afford travel costs to return home.\n“Our house was bombed, and inside it were so many memories – my photos, my certificates. I had dresses and so many belongings, but the house was destroyed, and I haven’t been able to see it since,” Sama said when CNN revisited the family in February.\n“Transportation costs are too high, and even if we go, there is no water, and we don’t know where we would stay,” she continued.\nProviding mental health services in Gaza has always come with challenges. But Dr. Yasser Abu Jamei, director of the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme (GCMHP), explained that during Israel’s 15-month assault his staff had also suffered trauma which made it difficult to treat others.\n“Most of my staff are working from displaced places and only less than 10 of them are still in their homes,” Abu Jamei, director of Gaza’s biggest mental health program, told CNN in an interview before the ceasefirewas agreed in January.\n“They still carry on and try to bring some hope and support to families (while) working in shelters.”\nOne technique he said the GCMHP employs is drawing therapy, which allows children to express their feelings through non-verbal communication. He recalled an instance in which giving a child the space to draw enabled them to talk to a GCMHP psychologist about their pain.\n“(The child said) my friends are in heaven, but one of them, they found him without his head,” Abu Jamei said. “How could he go to heaven while his head is not there? (The child) continued to cry.”\nWhile the fragile ceasefire held, Abu Jamei said the GCMHP was employing a mental health plan to treat patients which could last for up to six months. GCMHP workers were “relieved” by the pause in fighting, he added, but still felt a “heaviness of the work that awaits them.”\nSeven-year-old Anas Abu Eish and his sister Doa, aged eight, live with their grandmother Om-Alabed in a displacement camp in the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis. The siblings suffered the loss of their parents in an Israeli strike.\n“I was playing with my ball, I went down the stairs and I found Dad and Mom, thrown in the street, a drone came and exploded (on) them,” Anas told CNN in November 2024.\nOm-Alabed said the children had been deeply affected by what happened and that Anas experiences moments of aggression whenever he sees other children being embraced by their mothers.\n“I frequently remind people to be understanding, as he has lost not only his parents but also the safety, security, warmth, and affection (they) provided,” she said.\nWhen CNN began to interview Doa, she distracted herself by applying pressure to her nails; seconds later she began to cry.\nReviewing the footage of Anas and Doa, with the consent of their grandmother, Israeli psychologist and professor at the University of Pennsylvania Edna Foa told CNN that she remained hopeful the siblings could make a recovery.\n“They are interacting. I’ve seen children, they just look at you and they don’t say anything. They don’t cry, they just look at the space (around them), I worry about (those) children more,” Foa said.\nThough their home is close by in Rafah, Anas and Doa remained in Al-Mawasi even after the truce was agreed, unable to return as it was under a “red zone” designation – an area considered likely to be targeted if hostilities resumed.\nOm-Alabed said after the ceasefire was announced, they did travel back and found their house in ruins. It felt too dangerous to stay there. “We couldn’t handle it,” she said. “We are here waiting and dreaming that our red zone becomes a green zone so we can go back and put our tents over the rubble.”\n“All the buildings are crashed into each other,” Om-Alabed continued. “To walk from here to there, you have to climb rubble as if you are climbing a mountain, just to get to our area.”\nIn the same displacement camp, six-year-old Manal Jouda calmly recalls the night her home was destroyed, killing her parents and trapping her under the rubble. She described the terror of waiting to be rescued.\n“There was sand in my mouth, I was screaming, they dug with a shovel, our neighbor was saying ‘this is Manal, this is Manal.’ I was awake, my eyes were opened under the rubble, my mouth was opened, and sand was coming into it,” she said.\n“This is the kind of child I would follow to see if there was a way of reducing the pain her brain will hold later on,” Foa said of Manal.\nEven with a ceasefire, children need stability to help aid their healing, Foa said. But she believes that with the right treatment, Palestinian children can make a partial recovery.\n“They will never be the same as before the war, but they will recover in the sense that they could be functional,” she said.\n“They can be content most of the time, not be distressed, not being dysfunctional and go on with their life.”\nBut for children like Sama, stability remains out of reach.\nHeavy rain and strong winds have battered displacement camps, destroying makeshift tents and leaving the young girl and other Palestinian families with little shelter.\nEven with a truce in place, her hair didn’t grow back and she wonders if it ever will.\n“Every time my hair starts to grow, I look at it with hope, but then it falls out again,” she said.\nHer mother explained that Sama feels ashamed of having no hair, even in front of her sisters, and feels she can’t restart her life until it regrows.\n“Sama always told me ‘I want to go to the north to find my clothes and my memories,’” Om-Mohammed said.\n“But now she has changed her mind and says ‘where would we go? We don’t have a home anymore; all my friends have hair, and I don’t.’”",

(AP Photo/Yousef Al Zanoun)\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli troops fired over the ceasefire line in the northernGaza Stripon Friday, killing at least five Palestinians, including a baby, according to a local hospital that received the casualties. The killings came as thetenuous Israel-Hamas trucehas stalled in recent weeks.\nThe five died in Tuffah, an eastern neighborhood in Gaza City, said Rami Mhanna, managing director of Shifa Hospital.\nIsrael’s military said troops identified “a number of suspicious individuals … in command structures west of the Yellow Line,” and fired at them. The incident is under review and the military “regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals,” it added.\nThe Yellow Line divides the Israeli-held part of Gaza from the rest of the territory, and was drawn under theU.S.-brokered ceasefire agreementthat went into effect in October.\nAlso Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump’sMideast envoy Steve Witkoffwas planning to host in Florida top officials from Middle Eastern countries mediating the Gaza ceasefire, according to a U.S. official.\nThe talks are an effort to push the ceasefire into its second, much more complex phase.\nThe first phase began in October, days after the two-year anniversary of the initial Hamas-led attack on Israel that killed around 1,200 people.All but one of the 251 hostagestaken that day have been released,alive or dead, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees.\nThe war in Gaza has killed more than 70,660 Palestinians, roughly half of them women and children, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its count. The ministry, which operates under the Hamas-run government, is staffed by medical professionals and maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by the international community.\nThough the ceasefire, now in its third month, has mostly held, its progress has slowed amid accusations of violations by both sides.\nThe second phase of the deal is supposed to involve even bigger challenges — the deployment of an international stabilization force, a technocratic governing body for Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and further Israeli troop withdrawals from the territory.\nFind more of AP’s Israel-Hamas coverage athttps://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war",
