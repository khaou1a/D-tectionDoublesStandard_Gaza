            "content": "Fox News national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin provides an update on the one million refugees who have crossed the border into Poland.\nYael Eckstein, president and CEO of The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews (IFCJ), told Fox News Digital via an email exchange this weekend amid her latest trip to Europe that she \"thought she had seen it all.\"\nShe elaborated, \"I have worked inthe humanitarian aid fieldfor over 16 years. I thought I had seen it all. But in the past seven days,\" she added — referring to Russia's assault on Ukraine — \"I have witnessed suffering and desperation that I have never seen in my lifetime.\"\nEckstein said that for her, \"the most heartbreaking thing was seeing orphans whom The Fellowship supports [caught] in the middle of a war zone.\"\nRUSSIA ATTACKS UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES\nAmid that suffering and desperation, however, comes a dramatic story of planning, escape, care and — at least for now — a semblance of calm during the storm that is most of Ukraine right now. And it wouldn't have happened if not for the support, the prayers and the help of many people, including those who have donated to important charities over the years.\nThe Fellowship shared with Fox News Digital details of the successful rescue of about 100 children from Ukraine over the past few days — and the latest news about where they've landed.\nUKRAINE MOTHER DESCRIBES RUSSIA'S ATTACKS AS ‘EVIL’\nIt all began in Zhytomyr, Ukraine, where a woman named Malcki Bukiat was running an orphanage for children from \"socially challenged families,\" The Fellowship reported to Fox News Digital. Some of these children are orphans; others had parents who couldn't care for them. For the bulk of the year — from the age of 4 years old until age 17 — the students lived at the orphanage.\nYael Eckstein is a mother of four and president of The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews. She and members of her team and others helped arrange for the dramatic rescue of children and orphans from Ukraine on Sunday, March 6, 2022, amid the tragedy and violence of Russia's attacks on Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24, 2022.\nYet when the war on Ukraine began, Bukiat \"found herself responsible for the lives of the children at the orphanage,\" as well as for the children of two other Jewish families that lived together with the school community — plus her own five children.\nSaid Bukiat, \"We knew the situation [was] very dangerous. We saw that it became even worse in the last day, before we left. We were theoretically ready to take the kids toward the border — but, practically, it was very complicated.\"\nAwakening to the sound of explosions one morning at 5 a.m., Bukiat said she knew she had to evacuate the children immediately.\nAn aerial view shows a residential building destroyed by shelling, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, in the settlement of Borodyanka in the Kyiv region, Ukraine, on March 3, 2022. This image was taken with a drone.(REUTERS/Maksim Levin/File Photo)\n\"When you have to organize a trip of nearly 60 children — not including [your own] children [and other children] — with their basic needs, their documents and the papers from families, and at the same time you have to try to keep them calm and mentally balanced, it is not easy,\" she said.\n\"It took us a couple of hours. We told the kids to take only the most important things: clothes, personal medicines. We prepared some food for the way, as we knew the way was going to be very long,\" she added. \"And we left Zhytomyr, moving to the west, in [a] bus.\"\n\"The [children] were very scared and some of them cried\" during the trip westward.\nThe International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, along with Chabad, planned this rescue mission for these children. The group mapped out the route based on what they knew about the path and the terrain — and about the bombings that were going on in Ukraine.\nBukiat shared that during this bus trip, \"it was very difficult to keep the children calm. They were not used to seeing tanks, military vehicles and soldiers. They were very scared and some of them cried,\" she said.\n\"They needed us to support them, and we had to convey calmness to protect them from trauma.\" The trip took 15 hours, Bukiat said.\nThese Ukrainian children and others were evacuated from the Zhytomyr children's home — and in this image, are shown sheltering in Chernovtsi, in western Ukraine.(The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews)\n\"The traffic jam was endless. Thousands of people were trying to escape to the borders. People were out of gas, food and water,\" she said.\n\"Some of these [travelers] had been [on the road] for three days or more,\" she said, \"hiding from bombs and rockets in the open areas because they couldn’t arrive [at proper] shelters.\"\nShe said that \"in the gas station, each vehicle could buy only 10 liters of gas. Thank God, we had our gas tank full.\"\nADOPTIVE MOM SHARES MESSAGE FOR PUTIN: ‘UKRAINE IS UKRAINE! LET IT BE’\nThroughout this rough journey, things were \"not easy\" for Bukiat, she said. She finally realized that she needed help. So \"I gathered the elder children, ages 14-15, and I [told] them I needed them to take care of the little ones. Everybody got an important role, and they did a fantastic job. We declared that our slogan was ‘everybody for everybody,’ and the children acted according to this principle.\"\nChildren from an orphanage in Zhytomyr (in western Ukraine) are shown here. A rabbi reported that 60 children, ages 6-17, were evacuated on Feb. 24 to Chernivtsi, which is close to the border with Moldova. The children woke up on Feb. 24, 2022, to sounds of explosions. They decided to act immediately to evacuate all the children to a safer region. They tried to organize another bus for Jewish families in Zhytomyr to send them even further west. IFCJ has supported this children's home for many years.(The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews)\nShe said they drove through open areas, \"and it was scary. We passed checkpoints, we met some other people and I could not always be sure if they were harmless or dangerous,\" she added.\"The [journey] was challenging. We prayed a lot.\"\nBukiat said the group then \"finally arrived at the area of the [Carpathian] mountains, where Chabad members rented us a hotel. The first thing we needed\" to do, she said, was \"get some necessities — clothes, toothpaste, shampoo — all the different things that the kids [had left behind, at the orphanage].\"\nPRAYERS FOR UKRAINE: AMERICAN FAITH LEADERS SHARE FERVENT CONCERNS\nAfter that, she said the adults created \"a day program that was the closest we could do to the one they were used to. The best way to calm the children,\" she said wisely, \"was to bring them back to their routine.\"\nSome of the travelers who made their way from an orphanage in western Ukraine, amid the shellings and bombings from Russia, are shown here — with the ultimate goal of safely reaching Israel, where people were waiting to help them and care for them during this traumatic time.(The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews)\nBukiat said that on Sunday, however, she \"began to feel that the situation [had become even] worse than before. We heard more explosions and people who came to the hotel told us that this area wasn't safe anymore. We decided that there was no choice — we [had] to take the kids to the other side of the border.\"\nThe group made its way to Romania, across the border — and Bukiat reported that there, all the children were \"safe.\" From that point, the group prepared to fly to Israel.\nUKRAINE'S ORPHANS ARE TOP OF MIND FOR ADOPTIVE DAD AND HIS ORGANIZATION\nBukiat shared this important note about the treacherous trip: \"You know, I didn’t [see] any difference between my own biological children and the schoolchildren. We were raised on the Jewish brotherhood principle — every Jew is precious to me. You ask me if I was scared at some point. Yes, I was, of course.\"\nThis little one got out of Ukraine safely, with the help of many people and multiple organizations.(The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews)\nYet \"I am a believing woman,\" she added. \"And, you know, you can believe in God and you can fully trust God.\" She said she fully \"trusted God\" and said she felt that \"everything [would] be all right.\"\n\"These innocent children endured days of fear and treacherous travel,\" said members of The Fellowship. The groups worked nonstop for days preparing for the trip.\n\"I shed tears of joy when I heard they crossed the border out of Ukraine,\" said Yael Eckstein.\nOn Sunday, March 6, the children finally arrived in Israel, via several flights. The trip was a joint operation by Israel’s Aliyah and Absorption Ministry, the Jewish Agency, and The Fellowship, the latter group explained.\nThe International Fellowship of Christians and Jews was one of the groups that helped arrange this successful flight amid multiple challenges in Ukraine. Vulnerable Ukrainian children are now being cared for in Israel.(The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews)\nThe Fellowship also told Fox News Digital that it worked tirelessly with government officials to ensure that the children had the travel documentation necessary for the trip.\nUpon arrival, they were greeted by The Fellowship's Eckstein — as well as by Israel Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.\nEVERYDAY UKRAINIANS STRUGGLE TO STAY ALIVE, ARE GRATEFUL FOR HELP, PRAYERS\nThe orphans will be staying, for now at least, at a school campus in Israel. The Fellowship team is providing \"immediate temporary housing and aid for their basic essentials,\" the group said.\nIn total, approximately 300 immigrants made it safely to Israel as part of this overall operation.\nIsrael’s Prime Minister, Naftali Bennett, holds a child who made it safely out of Ukraine amid the war; Bennett is accompanied by his wife, Gilat Bennett.(The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews/Office of the Prime Minister of Israel)\n\"Thank God that generous friends, especially Christians, had already provided over $3 million to help Ukraine's Jews over the last week,\" Eckstein told Fox News Digital earlier.\n\"We are so grateful they've helped us help them — but we're going to need more.\"\nEckstein also told Fox News Digital, \"I followed their evacuation closely from Israel, with anticipation and prayer. I shed tears of joy when I heard they crossed the border out of Ukraine.\"\n\"Now,\" she added, \"The Fellowship is so blessed to be able to bring them home to Israel, where they will be cared for and loved.\"\nShe said her Fellowship group was able \"to do this lifesaving work quickly and effectively because we’ve been on the ground in the former Soviet Union for 30 years.\"\nAdded Eckstein, \"We have the vast network of staff, partners and volunteers to get things done efficiently and effectively, even in a time of war.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nShe also said, \"I truly believe that when my father founded The Fellowship nearly 40 years ago, it was leading up to being able to provide people in the greatest need with aid and comfort in a time like this.\"\nMaureen Mackey is managing editor of Lifestyle at Fox News Digital.",

In a press release issued on Thursday, March 3, UNICEF said it’s likely that the child death and injury toll is higher than what’s on record so far.\nOn March 1, 2022, a family travels with small children to the Lviv-Holovnyi railway station in Lviv, Ukraine as the Russia-Ukraine war continues.(UNICEF/Viktor Moskaliuk)\n\"The use of explosive weapons in cities could quickly turn this crisis into a catastrophe for Ukraine’s children,\" said UNICEF Regional Director Afshan Khan, who covers the organization’s Europe- and Central Asia-focused operations.\n\"There are no armed operations of this scale that do not result in children being harmed. The consequences will be tragic,\" Khan continued. \"UNICEF is on the ground, doing its best to meet children’s basic needs, but the only way out of the tragedy unfolding in Ukraine is for the conflict to end.\"\nUKRAINE'S CHILDREN: HOW TO HELP VULNERABLE KIDS AMID RUSSIA'S ATTACK\nHomes, schools, orphanages, health centers and several other essential service providers have been damaged or destroyed along with critical water infrastructure systems in Ukraine, UNICEF reports.\nUNICEF is working with partner organizations to aid refugees with clean drinking water, medical supplies, shelter, sanitation services and education.\nUNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russel speaks to volunteers at the Ukraine-Romania border crossing at Sighetu Marmatiei, on March 2, 2022.(UNICEF/Adrian Câtu)\nThe organization also intends to scale its response to the Russia-Ukraine refugee crisis in neighboring countries by addressing the \"urgent needs of children and families\" who have recently crossed border lines.\nUKRAINIAN PROFESSOR RECALLS COUNTRY'S INDEPENDENCE DAY IN LIGHT OF WAR: 'UKRAINE WILL WIN'\nA part of UNICEF’s relief efforts will go toward building additional \"Blue Dot\" hubs along transit routes, which will serve as \"safe spaces\" where children and mothers can get access to the services they need.

That's almost one child per second.\nRUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES\nDr. Maryam S. Sharifian, a James Madison University assistant professor of education specializing in refugee children, expressed to Fox News Digital her concern for the suffering Ukrainian children as they abandon family members, friends and belongings for a foreign destination that is still, during their treks and travels, unknown to them, in many cases.\n\"We all have heard [of] separation anxiety as a phenomenon during the early childhood stage,\" she said. \"This process is confusing, stressful and difficult to comprehend for children.\"\nA mother in Ukraine cries with her young son before getting a train to Lviv at the Kyiv station, Ukraine, on March 3, 2022. (AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti)\nDr. Sharifian said children exposed to war can exhibit such PTSD symptoms as fear, frustration, anxiety, fluctuation in physical activity, lack of sleep, clinging (to parents, siblings or teachers), decreased concentration, loss of appetite and angry outbursts or tantrums.\nUKRAINIAN REFUGEE CHILDREN FACING DISORIENTATION, EXPLOITATION DURING DANGEROUS TREK FROM HOME\nVarious studies, the doctor also indicated, show that more than half of all children exposed to war trauma exhibit these kinds of PTSD symptoms.\nOne out of every four children attending school have been exposed to an event that can impact learning and behavior, she also said.\nUKRAINIAN PASTOR REMAINS AMID WAR TO HELP THE SUFFERING\n\"War trauma not only affects the current health conditions of children — their future education may also be severely affected by these experiences,\" she said.\nA woman and children taken refuge in a school bomb shelter in Sartana village, which is under the control of the Government of the Donetsk People's Republic, some 11 miles northeast of Mariupol, Ukraine, on March 16, 2022.(AP Photo/Alexei Alexandrov)\nOther professionals such as Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel have also expressed concern, highlighting the potential long-term effects of disorientation and exploitation that kids may encounter on the journey far from home.\n\"If the parents show [the children] courage and show them the way forward — kids will respond and they will heal.\"\nDr. Siegel spoke with Save the Children's U.K. senior humanitarian health lead Ayesha Kadir, saying that refugee children face a \"very high\" mortality rate due to these high-stakes elements.\nUKRAINE BOY'S ADOPTION STALLS AMID RUSSIA'S ATTACKS: ‘IT’S MY KID,' ALABAMA MAN SAYS\nBut Siegel said that kids can easily recover through the right therapy.\n\"Kids are resilient,\" he said on\"America’s Newsroom\"last week. \"If the parents show them courage, and they show them the way forward, kids will respond and they will heal.\"\nEven though children are often always the first victims during wartime, Dr. Sharifian also told Fox News Digital that learning from successful strategies in history can help prevent permanent psychological damage.\nStudies in Israel and Syria, for example, explore Building Resilience Intervention (BRI) for students.\nA woman carries a crying child as she arrives at the train station in Zahony, Hungary, on March 5, 2022. (AP Photo/Darko Vojinovic)\n\"Strategies such as enhancing self-esteem, self-efficacy and optimism in children by teaching them decision-making skills, achievable tasks and spirituality have much potential,\" she said.\n\"Resilience is an important factor in preparing them to move on to a healthy and successful future.\"\n\"[Parents] should also help children to identify and label emotions and feelings, express their feelings and ask for help.\"\nThe professor encouraged parents and caretakers of struggling refugee children to establish routines and rituals and have open conversations about safety.\nShe also suggested using relaxation tactics such as breathing exercises, music and exercise.\nEXPLAINING WAR TO KIDS AS RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE\n\"They should also help children to identify and label emotions and feelings, express their feelings and ask for help,\" she said.\n\"Parents can also role-play and ask children what they would tell a best friend, toy, or stuffed animal to do when they are scared. It is also a practical strategy … to help them navigate their feelings [and] to learn about coping strategies.\"\nCivilians are shown in Irpin, Ukraine, as they continue to flee from Russia's ongoing attacks on the Ukrainian people on March 8, 2022.(Photo by Emin Sansar/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\nA variety of organizations have joined in to help spread awareness and take in donations for Ukraine's kids.\nThat includesUNICEF USA and Save the Children;as Fox News Digital has previously reported, the latter provides access to education, psychosocial support, hygiene kits and cash grants to families in need.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAlso, anyone can donate to the Red Cross during this Russia-Ukraine war —contributions now exceed $9 million for FOX Corporation's supportof the Red Cross in Ukraine.\nAngelica Stabile is a lifestyle reporter for Fox News Digital.",

            "content": "Brett Velicovich, an Army veteran working with HARP Rescue, joined 'The Next Revolution' to discuss what life is like on the ground in Ukraine as Putin's assault continues.\nThe humanitarian crisis inUkraineis a growing concern as at least 117 children have been killed as of Tuesday, though the true figure is likely higher, and aid organizations estimate areas that have seen some of the most intense fighting have just three to four days of essentials, such as food.\nAccording to its most recent report published Tuesday, the Office of theUnited NationsHigh Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) confirmed at least 925 civilians have been killed and 1,496 have been injured in Ukraine since the onset of the Russian invasion 27 days ago on Feb. 24. Estimates of Russian deaths vary, but even conservative figures are in the low thousands.\nIn an address to Italian Parliament Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that at least 117 children have died so far in the first 27 days of the war in his country.\nDEFENSE SEC AUSTIN SAYS RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN IN UKRAINE ‘STALLED,’ PUTIN'S STRATEGY FEEDS TROOPS IN ‘WOOD CHIPPER’\n\"And we know that every next day of war will take more lives of our children. 117 is not the final number,\" he said. \"The Russian invasion will still destroy families and destinies.\"\nThat means at least 38 more children have been killed since Zelenskyy spoke at a rally in Florence and to European leaders more than a week ago, urging them to remember the number 79.\n\"Such is the price of procrastination,\" Zelenskyy told Italian parliament of the dozens more children dead. \"Calling for pressure on Russia to stop this cruel war. 117 children, thousands of adults. Thousands of people are injured. Tens of thousands of families devastated. Hundreds of thousands of destroyed destinies. Millions and millions of abandoned homes. And it all started with one man.\"\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addresses the Italian parliament via video link, in Rome, Tuesday, March 22, 2022.((Roberto Monaldo/LaPresse via AP))\nMore than 70,000 Ukrainian refugees, including some 25,000 children, are currently in Italy, Zelenskyy said, noting in connection to pregnant refugees, that the first Ukrainian baby was born in Italy.\nThe global nongovernmental organization Mercy Corps said Tuesday that one of the largest areas of concern in Ukraine is the vulnerability of the supply chain. Most municipalities that have seen some of the heaviest fighting only have between three and four days of food as \"the humanitarian system is entirely broken down,\" Mercy Corps’ Ukraine humanitarian response adviser, Steve Gordon, told CNN.\nWhile the U.N. has been able to get aid to some areas, humanitarian corridors have been largely blocked and compared to what’s normally a \"high-functioning, coordinated international aid effort\" in other conflict zones, many people in Ukraine are only surviving due to small Ukrainian civil society organizations, including church volunteers, who are coordinating deliveries of food and medical supplies, he said.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s forces are increasingly concentrating their air power and artillery on Ukraine’s cities and the civilians living there. Moscow’s invasion has driven nearly 3.5 million people from Ukraine, according to the U.N., with another 6.5 million displaced inside the country.\nU.S. and British officials say Kyiv remains Russia’s primary objective. The bulk of Moscow’s forces remain miles from the city center, but missiles and artillery have destroyed apartment buildings and a large shopping mall, which was left a smoking ruin after being hit late Sunday by strikes that killed eight people, according to emergency officials.\nUKRAINIAN DEPUTY MAYOR OF HOME TO EUROPE'S LARGEST NUCLEAR PLANT ABDUCTED BY RUSSIAN OCCUPYING FORCES\nThe OHCHR said it believes that the actual figures for civilian casualties are considerably higher, especially in territory still controlled by the Ukrainian government and especially in recent days.\nThe U.N. agency said information has been delayed and many reports are pending corroboration from areas where intense hostilities have been going on such as in the southern port city of Mariupol and Volnovakha in the Donetsk region, Izium in the Kharkiv region, Sievierodonetsk and Rubizhne in the Luhansk region, and Trostianets in Sumy region, amid claims of numerous civilian casualties there.\nIn areas like Sumy, there are about 800,000 people \"nearly entirely reliant\" on aid shipped in on a day-to-day basis, Gordon said.\nIn Mariupol, with communications crippled, movement restricted and many residents in hiding, the fate of those inside an art school flattened on Sunday and a theater that was blown apart four days earlier was unclear. More than 1,300 people were believed to be sheltering in the theater, and 400 were estimated to have been in the art school.\nFirefighters try to extinguish a fire amid the destruction caused after shelling of a shopping center, in Kyiv, Ukraine, Monday, March 21, 2022.((AP Photo/ (AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd))\nA woman holds a child in an improvised bomb shelter in Mariupol, Ukraine, Monday, March 7, 2022.((AP Photo/Mstyslav Chernov))\nPeople carry wooden boards to cover the windows of a building damaged by a bombing the previous day in Kyiv, Ukraine, Monday, March 21, 2022. As Russia intensified its effort to pound Mariupol into submission, its ground offensive in other parts of Ukraine has become bogged down. Western officials and analysts say the conflict is turning into a grinding war of attrition, with Russia bombarding cities.((AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda))\nIt is not clear how close Mariupol's capture might be. Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday that their forces were still defending the city and had destroyed a Russian patrol boat and electronic warfare complex.\nOver the weekend, Moscow had offered safe passage out of Mariupol — one corridor leading east to Russia, another going west to other parts of Ukraine — in return for the city’s surrender before daybreak Monday. Ukraine flatly rejected the offer well before the deadline.\nMariupol had a prewar population of about 430,000. Around a quarter were believed to have left in the opening days of the war, and tens of thousands escaped over the past week by way of the humanitarian corridors. Other attempts have been thwarted by the fighting. Mariupol's officials said on March 15 that at least 2,300 people had died in the siege, with some buried in mass graves. There has been no official estimate since then, but the number is feared to be far higher after six more days of bombardment.\nZelenskyy’s count of dead children was two more than the 115 total recorded by the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine as of 8 a.m. local time Monday. At least 148 more children had been injured by then, according to the prosecutor’s office. The U.N. said it was still working to corroborate a report from the Head of the Investigative Department of the National Police of Kharkiv Region saying 276 civilians, including 15 children, had been killed in the region as of Monday at 6 p.m. local time.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe OHCHR has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine since 2014, the same year Russia annexed Crimea, but since the Russian military invaded on Feb. 24, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has been unable to visit places of incidents and interview witnesses and victims.\nAs a result, the U.N. explained that the usual method of corroboration and crosschecking information was disrupted in Ukraine, so the current figures are based on individual civilian casualty records where the \"reasonable grounds to believe\" standard of proof was met.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nDanielle Wallace is a breaking news and politics reporter at Fox News Digital.

            "content": "Trump's special envoy to Russia and Ukraine Keith Kellogg joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss how he believes the war will eventually end through an economic means amid growing pressure for a peace deal.\nMore than 200,000 children have been abducted by Russia since the start of its invasionof Ukraine, Chairman Emeritus of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said, citing U.S. estimates.\n\"If a foreign adversary took 260,000 of our kids, and they were in indoctrination camps, I mean, how would we feel about that?\" McCaul asked Fox News Digital.\nThe Texas Republican was recently term-limited in his time as chairman of the foreign affairs panel, but he is continuing to work on the world stage, in part by raising awareness about Russia’s atrocities in Ukraine. Among the most egregious is the relocation of thousands of Ukrainian children into Russia, the vast majority of whom have not been returned.\nSome parents would be coerced into giving up their children because Russian forces were threatening to bomb their city, McCaul said, while other times \"they just invade and capture the children.\"\nPUTIN, XI VOW TO ‘DEEPEN’ ALLIANCE HOURS AFTER TRUMP RE-ENTERS THE WHITE HOUSE\nRep. Michael McCaul, chairman emeritus of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, left, discussed his efforts to bring awareness to the thousands of Ukrainian children taken into President Vladimir Putin's Russia.(Getty Images)\nThe International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants in February 2023 for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia’s commissioner for children’s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, \"for the war crime of unlawful deportation of [children] and that of unlawful transfer of [children] from occupied areas of Ukraine.\"\nLvova-Belova was sanctioned last year by the U.S. over her part in the scheme, which has been widely condemned by western governments.\nHowever, the Kremlin has denied war crime allegations and maintained it is doing humanitarian work facilitating homes for Ukrainian children,NPR reported.\nExisting accounts from returned children and elsewhere paint a picture of forced indoctrination within Russia’s borders, however. Some of those children are given military training, according to theYale Humanitarian Research Lab, likely in preparation to fight on Russia’s front lines.\nZELENSKYY LAMBASTS PUTIN FOR CHRISTMAS STRIKES: ‘WHAT COULD BE MORE INHUMANE?’\nEmergency services work to rescue civilians trapped under the rubble of a destroyed building after a Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine on Dec. 10, 2024.(Photo by Zaporizhzhia Regional Military Adminstration / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images)\nEstimates on how many children have been taken to Russia vary between 20,000 to upwards of 250,000.\nPart of McCaul’s work raising awareness about Russia’s treatment of Ukrainian children will include a screening ofa documentary titled, \"Children in the Fire: Ukraine’s War Through the Children’s Eyes\" by filmmaker Evgeny Afineevsky, at the Munich Security Conference next month.\nHe has also worked with the nonprofit Save Ukraine, which is working to return children.\n\"In the documentary, the child's brought into this prison where it looks like adults are being— basically they're using electrodes to shock them, you know, under their fingernails and their genitals, and it's just very, very barbaric,\" McCaul said.\nHe also held a hearing last year on the issue while leading the foreign affairs committee.\nMcCaul said Russia’s abduction of children is among the most vile of its alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions. He compared it to infamous Nazi physician Josef Mengele’s experiments on Jewish children and adults.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has led the country through Russia's invasion.(GENYA SAVILOV/AFP via Getty Images)\n\"It's just evil. I mean, any civilization that would capture— I mean, it's one thing if you're on the battlefield killing the enemy, from their point of view,\" McCaul said. \"But to capture the children to re-indoctrinate them is sort of reminiscent of, you know, Mengele’s experiments on kids…And I don't think we've seen anything like this in recent society.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe House passed a resolution last year condemning Russia’s abduction of Ukrainian children in a bipartisan 390 to 9 vote.\n\"It's just horrific. I can't imagine, as a father, my children being, you know, taken away by the Russian Federation and then not knowing where they are or what's happening to them,\" McCaul said. \"But this is all part of Putin's game, is to try to indoctrinate the children in Ukraine to go against their own country and belief system.\"\nElizabeth Elkind is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital leading coverage of the House of Representatives.

Greg Landsman, said.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP TOUTS 'GREAT' PHONE CALL WITH RUSSIA'S VLADIMIR PUTIN\nA group of Democratic U.S. lawmakers penned a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.(Reuters)\nNews of the letter came on Tuesday, the same day U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who stopped short of agreeing to a 30-day truce in Moscow'swar against Ukraine.\nA person familiar with the tracking program said the canceled State Department contract led to the deletion of $26 million in war crimes evidence.\n\"They took $26 million of U.S. taxpayers money used for war crimes data and threw it into the woodchipper, including the dossiers on all the children,\" the person told Reuters.\n\"If you wanted to protect President Putin from prosecution, you nuke that thing. And they did it. It’s the final court-admissible version with all the metadata,\" the person added.\nThe U.S. State Department has ended funding for tracking thousands of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia.(Celal Gunes/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\nThe letter to administration officials also calls for sanctions to punish officials in Russia and its ally Belarus who are involved in abducting children.\n\"These egregious, openly acknowledged violations of the rights of children afforded under international law demand consequences,\" the letter said.\nYale University's Humanitarian Research Lab also no longer has access to the satellite imagery needed to track the abducted children, according to the lawmakers.\n\"Our government is providing an essential service – one that does not require the transfer of weapons or cash to Ukraine – in pursuit of the noble goal of rescuing these children. We must, immediately, resume the work to help Ukraine bring these children home,\" the letter said.\nRUSSIA WANTS ‘IRONCLAD’ GUARANTEE THAT UKRAINE WILL BE BARRED FROM NATO: OFFICIAL\nNews of the letter came on Tuesday, the same day U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin.(Getty Images / Fox News Digital)\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nUkraine has described the abductions of tens of thousands of its childrentaken to Russiaor Russian-occupied territory without parental consent as a war crime that meets the U.N. treaty definition of genocide.\nRussia has claimed it has been evacuating people voluntarily to protect vulnerable children from being caught in the crossfire.\nIn March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued warrants for the arrest of Lvova-Belova and Putin in connection with the abduction of Ukrainian children, a move Russia denounced as \"outrageous and unacceptable.\"\nEurojust, Europe's agency for criminal cooperation, said on Tuesday it learned the U.S. government was ending its support for the International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine, which was collecting evidence to prosecute Putin and others.

            "content": "National security expert Andrew Borene breaks down what's next as the president continues to work to end the fighting as Russia escalates attacks.\nLast winter, a Ukrainian mother received the call she had been waiting for: her daughter, taken across the border to Russia months earlier, was finally coming home. When they embraced, the girl hugged tightly, afraid she might be pulled away again. She hardly spoke, afraid to use the Ukrainian language after being forced to speak only Russian.\nThat reunion was a miracle for this mother, but thousands and thousands of parents are still waiting. Just 1,600abducted childrenhave returned home.\nIn the three and a half years since Russian President Vladimir Putin’s unprovokedinvasion of Ukraine, Russia has kidnapped an estimated 20,000Ukrainian children. The real number is likely much higher, because Russia has targeted orphanages and vulnerable kids who may not be identified. It’s also difficult to trace everyone in the midst of war and occupation. Russia itself claims over 700,000 children have been so-called \"evacuated.\"\nUKRAINE’S STOLEN CHILDREN CRISIS LOOMS LARGE AS NATO MEETS ON RUSSIA’S WAR\nThe more time that goes by, the harder it will be to find these kids. Their names and origins are being obscured. Their faces and voices change as they grow up, making them harder to identify. Some are so young they may entirely forget where they came from.\nA new report from Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab makes clear just how systematic this program has become. Researchers have identified at least 210 facilities where Ukrainian children have been held across Russia and occupied Ukraine — from summer camps and sanatoriums to cadet schools, a monastery and even a military base. At more than130 of these sites, children undergo forced \"re-education\" programs designed to erase their Ukrainian identity and instill loyalty to Russia. And at nearly 40 locations, children are subjected to military-style training, including grenade-throwing, weapons assembly and drone operation.\nDisturbingly, this Yale report confirms that Putin’s government directly manages more than half of these facilities. Russia’s actions are right out of the KGB’s playbook, when the Soviets deported tens of thousands of women and children from the occupied Baltic countries in the 1940s and all native Crimean Tatars from the Crimean Peninsula.\nToday, these abducted children are given new names, forced into Russian citizenship and adopted into Russian families without consent. They are told to forget their language, their culture and their parents. Those who make it home carry invisible scars: disrupted education, broken trust and a trauma that can last a lifetime.\nWe cannot accept a world where kids are being abducted during war and we cannot allow children to be used as a form of hostage-taking for negotiations. Protecting children in conflict isn’t optional. It’s our humanitarian obligation and it’s a legal requirement under international law.\nAllowing these abductions to stand emboldens future aggressors, undermines international norms and betrays America’s most basic values.\nThat’s why we worked across the aisle to convene a bipartisan coalition of senators to introduce a resolution in May condemning Russia’s actions. Our measure also calls for the unconditional return of abducted Ukrainian children before any peace agreement is signed.\nThe resolution has earned endorsements from faith-based, child protection and human rights organizations, showing that Americans of all backgrounds understand these children’s basic rights.\nOur work to support these kids shows how both parties can come together to speak in one clear voice. We believe this unity tells parents in Ukraine and all over the globe, that America stands with them when theirchildren are in danger. After discussing the issue with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, PresidentDonald Trumpwas right to say that \"it is a subject at the top of all lists\" and that we must work to solve it.\nAlongside the resolution, we introduced the bipartisan Abducted Ukrainian Children Recovery and Accountability Act. This bill does three key things.\nFirst, it enhances support for Ukraine’s efforts to investigate and track the abducted children.\nSecond, it helps those children who do make it back home and need psychological, social and educational support during that difficult transition.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThird, it reinforces efforts to hold those who commit these crimes accountable, including through sanctions that are aligned with our allies. Ukraine’s prosecutors have opened tens of thousands of war crimes cases, and they need sustained support from us and our allies.\nNo peace can be just and no agreement credible until every child is safely returned. AsFirst Lady Melania Trumpwrote in her letter to Putin ahead of the Alaska Summit: \"it is time\" to end these children’s suffering.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIt’s unacceptable that these kids are being treated like prisoners of war — used for Putin’s propaganda and forced to do military training and join the ranks of Russia’s army. They must not become pawns used in any negotiations.\nThe mother who was reunited with her daughter was one of the lucky few. Tens of thousands of other parents are still waiting for that same call, for the day they can wrap their arms around their children again. Until then, the world must not look away.\nRepublican Chuck Grassley represents Iowa in the United States Senate.\nDemocrat Amy Klobuchar is the senior senator from Minnesota.",

            "content": "NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg joins ‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ to discuss world leaders attending the NATO summit in Washington D.C. this week.\nRescue operations stretched into a second day at a major Kyiv children’shospital struck by a Russian missile, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday, as officials raised the countrywide casualty toll to 42 dead and almost 200 injured in the previous day's intense daytime barrage that smashed into multiple cities.\nZelenskyy said on the social platform X that 64 people were hospitalized in the capital, as well as 28 in Kryvyi Rih and six in Dnipro — both cities in central Ukraine.\nIt was Russia’s heaviest bombardment of Kyiv in almost four months and one of the deadliest of the war, hitting seven of the city’s 10 districts. The strike on the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital, which interrupted open-heart surgery and forced young cancer patients to take their treatments outdoors, drew an international outcry.\nRUSSIAN MISSILES HIT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN KYIV AS UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY VOWS RETALIATION\nThe 10-story hospital, which is Ukraine's largest medical facility for children, was caring for some 670 patients at the time of the attack, Okhmatdyt’s Director General, Volodymyr Zhovnir, said Tuesday. The missile hit a two-story wing of the hospital.\n\"The building where we conducted dialysis for children with kidney failure or acute intoxication is ruined entirely,\" he told reporters, estimating the overall damage to the hospital at $2.5 million.\nDanielle Bell, the head of a U.N. team tracking human rights violations in Ukraine, said at least two people were killed at the hospital and some 50 people were injured, including seven children.\nEmergency services work at the site of Okhmatdyt children’s hospital hit by Russian missiles, in Kyiv, Ukraine, on July 8, 2024.(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka)\nThe casualty figure would have been much higher if patients hadn't been taken to a bunker when air raid sirens first sounded, she added.\nAuthorities were working to restore the hospital's power and water supply, Zhovnir said.\nKyiv city administrators declared Tuesday an official day of mourning. Entertainment events were prohibited and flags were lowered in the capital.\nRussia denied responsibility for the hospital strike, insisting it doesn’t attack civiliantargets in Ukrainedespite abundant evidence to the contrary, including Associated Press reporting.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday repeated that position, pointing to a Russian Defense Ministry statement that blamed a Ukrainian air defense missile for partially destroying the hospital.\nBell, the head of the U.N. team, dismissed that argument. She said an assessment of video footage and findings on site indicated the hospital \"took a direct hit, rather than receiving damage due to an intercepted weapons system.\"\nThe hospital likely was struck by a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile, Bell said. Ukrainian officials said the same.\nThe bodies of three more people were found Tuesday under the rubble of a residential building in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv, officials said, bringing the death toll in the single building to 10.\nThe Russian onslaught Monday came on the eve of a NATO summit in Washington where alliance countries are expected to pledge newmilitary and economic support for Ukraine.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, was hosting India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Moscow.\nNew Delhi’s importance as a key trading partner has grown since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nZelenskyy was deeply critical of Modi’s visit, saying on X late Monday: \"It is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world’s largest democracy hug the world’s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.\"\nMeanwhile, Russian military and regional officials said Tuesday that Ukrainian drones targeted six Russian regions overnight, in what appeared to be a bigger-than-usual aerial attack by Kyiv's forces.\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said air defense systems in five Russian southern and western regions \"destroyed and intercepted\" a total of 38 Ukrainian drones.",

We suffered pogroms, we suffered the Holocaust and we suffered anti-Semitism,\" Baird told the AP.\n\"We have a sense of obligation to help people who are suffering right now.\"\n\"And we have a sense of obligation to help people who are suffering right now.\"\nAfterRussia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24of this year, people across Poland sprang into action to welcome and help refugees from the neighboring country.\nPoland has accepted more of the war’s refugees than any other nation.\nLocal and international Jewish organizations also began working immediately to meet the most urgent needs: to house and feed Ukrainians, most of whom are women and children.\nAMID WAR'S TRAGEDIES, UKRAINE'S KIDS PAINT EGGS TO KEEP ‘LIFE’ GOING\nWith the war soon entering its sixth month, the camp at the Lauder Morasha School in Warsaw has reflected the type of programming being developed to meet the changing needs of refugees.\nA local resident walks next to a house that was destroyed in a Russian shelling in Kramatorsk, Ukraine.(AP Photo/Andriy Andriyenko)\nMany Ukrainians realize they won’t be able to go home soon — or perhaps ever — Helise Lieberman, director of the Taube Center for Jewish Life and Learning, told the AP.\nMornings were devoted to Polish, English and math lessons so the children will be in a stronger position to adapt to school.\nSome Ukrainian refugee mothers need to look for jobs — while others are severely depressed.\nMany of the Ukrainian kids who arrived in Poland since February finished the Ukrainian academic year remotely — but will start at Polish schools in September.\nCampers spent afternoons doing arts and crafts, playing sports and making excursions to city museums and parks.\nAbout a third of the 90 childrenwho attended the camp are Jewish, according to Marta Saracyn, the head of the Jewish Community Center of Warsaw.\n\"It’s a lovely bubble for kids to be kids,\" Saracyn told the AP.\nRefugees with children walk after fleeing the war from neighboring Ukraine at a railway station in Przemysl, Poland, on March 22, 2022.(AP Photo/Sergei Grits)\nSome of the Ukrainian refugee mothers need to look for jobs — while some are severely depressed after being separated from their partners and relatives back home, organizers said.\nThe Taube Center and the Jewish Community Center of Warsaw organized the camp in conjunction with the Jewish Federations of North America, the Jewish Agency for Israel and the American Joint Distribution Committee.\nThe Jewish Federations of North America recruited nearly 90 Russian-speaking educators and rabbinic leaders to help Ukrainian refugees in Poland and Hungary, and 10 helped out at the Warsaw camp, said Hannah Miller, who runs the volunteer program.\n\"You don’t need to be from Ukraine to help others,\" the rabbi said. \"You just need to be human.\"\nThe 10 camp volunteers are Russian-speaking immigrants who left the Soviet Union decades ago, or the children of Russian Jewish immigrants.\nOnly a couple spoke Ukrainian, so they mostly spoke to the children in Russian, which is also widely used in much of Ukraine.\nBaird recalled painting the face of a boy who became upset when he realized she wasn’t from Ukraine.\n\"Why did you come here?\" he asked her.\nIn this photo provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, left, listens to a report about the front line in the Donetsk region, Ukraine, on Sunday, June 5, 2022.(Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP, File)\n\"Because you don’t need to be from Ukraine to help others,\" the rabbi answered. \"You just need to be human.\"\nSimilarly, an extraordinary journey to bear witness to the struggle and strife of displaced Ukrainians — and to comfort them as well as observe relief efforts on their behalf — took place recently when a group from Temple Emanu-El's congregation on the Upper East Side of Manhattan traveled to the border of Ukraine and Poland.\nThe mission was one of faith, compassion, care and giving.\nNEW YORK CITY TEMPLE MEMBERS TRAVEL TO UKRAINE BORDER TO BRING COMFORT AND ‘BEAR WITNESS’\nWhen most Americans were just beginning to embrace the beginning of summer on Memorial Day weekend, the group from Temple Emanu-El — New York City’s leading Reform Jewish congregation — traveled to Ukraine instead.\nAs Rabbi Joshua M. Davidson told his congregation ahead of the mission, \"Together we will bring much-needed supplies, offer comfort to those fleeing the war — and bear witness both to the suffering and to the extraordinary efforts of the agencies offering relief from that suffering.\"\nRabbi Joshua Davidson described a special mission to the Ukraine border recently to his congregation in New York City during a Friday evening service.(Temple Emanu-El of New York City)\nThe group from Temple Emanu-El brought duffel bags filled with donated supplies from temple members for the desperate Ukrainians who have fled for their lives, said Martin Bell, one of the travelers on the mission.\nEvery place the group went, Bell related to Fox News Digital recently, they saw the relief efforts that had been \"started initially by everyday Poles\" — who have continued to run them to help the displaced Ukrainians, who are mostly women and children.\n\"We also made [the journey] to bear witness to the suffering of the Ukrainian people.\"\nHe said, \"The part about bearing witness — that's what really resonated with me and with everyone in our group. In part, that's maybe a Jewish reaction in a world wherethere are Holocaust deniers,\" said Bell.\n\"We wanted to go there so that we could then come back and tell other people what we saw.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\"It's a story that should be told. It's a story that must be told,\" he also said, as Fox News Digital reported earlier.\n\"We made the journey to bring relief,\" said Rabbi Davidson at a recent Friday evening temple service as he described the mission afterward to the congregation.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"But we also made it to bear witness to the suffering of the Ukrainian people, in a world that too often not only turns a blind eye to human suffering but allows it to be written out of history altogether.\"\n\"We just know from our own experience that bearing witness is a sacred duty.\"\nThe Associated Press contributed reporting to this article.\nMaureen Mackey is managing editor of Lifestyle at Fox News Digital.",

Her grandmother and caregiver, Nadia Kryminec, told AP that when doctors gave her granddaughter the opportunity to evacuate to Poland, she immediately took it.\n\"It is very difficult for children to go somewhere in the middle of the night and sit in the basement for a long time,\" Kryminec told AP.\n\"We were told that she was in stable condition, and we should try to go.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nRussia's invading forcesare deliberately using rape, torture and kidnapping to try and sow terror among civilians in Ukraine, the top prosecutor in Ukraine told U.S. lawmakers in graphic testimony Wednesday.\nProsecutor General Andriy Kostin said that nearly 80,000 cases ofwar crimeshave been registered in Ukraine since the war began in February 2022.\nFocusing on just one area of the country that has felt the brunt of the war, Kostin described some of the discoveries made when the Ukrainian military liberated Kherson last November. He said some 20 torture chambers were found and more than 1,000 survivors have reported an array of abuses, including the use of electric shocks, waterboarding, being forced to strip naked, and threats of mutilation and death.\nKostin said more than60 cases of rapewere documented in the Kherson region alone. In areas still controlled by Russian forces, residents, including children, are being forcefully relocated to other occupied territories or to Russia.\n\"Such evil cannot let be,\" Kostin said.\nJUDGE DELAYS LEAKED DOCUMENTS SUSPECT JACK TEIXEIRA'S COURT HEARING AFTER DEFENSE ASKS FOR MORE TIME\nThe House Foreign Affairs Committee invited Kostin to testify. The chairman, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, believes that spotlighting the brutality of Russia's actions will show lawmakers and voters why the United States is in the right in supporting Ukraine.\n\"This is happening right now. They are monsters and they need to be brought to justice,\" McCaul said. He added: \"These are more than war crimes. These are more than crimes against humanity. What we are witnessing in Ukraine is genocide.\"\nMcCaul also issued a challenge to fellow lawmakers, saying \"history will judge us by what we do here and now.\"\n\"No country can remain neutral in the face of such evil,\" McCaul said.\nCongress approved about $113 billion in economic, humanitarian and military spending in 2022 to assist Ukraine.President Joe Bidenhas repeatedly said the United States will help Ukraine \"as long as it takes\" to repel the Russian invasion that began in late February of last year, though support for that aid has softened, polling shows.\nUkrainian Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin listens before testifying at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine, on April 19, 2023, on Capitol Hill in Washington.(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\nCongressional leadersanticipate that Ukraine will need billions of dollars in additional assistance in the months ahead.\nOn Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted that he spoke by telephone with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and thanked him for bipartisan support from Congress. Zelenskyy also outlined the \"situation at the front\" and Ukraine’s \"urgent defense needs in armored vehicles, artillery, air defense & aircraft.\"\nThe House committeealso heard from a war crimes survivor, a 57-year-old woman, who said she was taken to a torture chamber for five days, beaten, forced to strip and endured threats of rape and murder. At one point, she was forced to dig her own grave. She said her house was looted. She has escaped, but other Ukrainians still experience such treatment in Russian-controlled territories, she said.\n\"These terrible crimes need to be stopped,\" she told lawmakers. Her identity was not revealed out of concerns about retribution.\nKostin said exposing atrocities is not enough.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Only with discovering and determining truth, bringing perpetrators to responsibility and providing adequate reoperations to victims and survivors, we can say justice has been done,\" Kostin said.\nThe International Criminal Courtissued an arrest warrant last month for Russian President Vladimir Putin for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine. But the practical implications are limited as the chances of Putin facing trial at the court are highly unlikely because Moscow does not recognize the court’s jurisdiction or extradite its nationals.",

Franklin Graham, CEO and presidentof Samaritan's Purse, told Fox News Digital on Monday evening in an exclusive message, \"It seems children always suffer the most during a war. Nearly two-thirds of all Ukrainian children have been displaced — and I’m sure that many of these boys and girls are wondering if they’ll ever see their homes or be reunited with their fathers again.\"\nRUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: LIVE UPDATES\nHe added urgently, \"They need our prayers.\"\nHe said, \"Samaritan’s Purse is providing medical care in six locations across Ukraine, as well as food and other critical relief supplies — but we also wanted to do something special for these children to let them know that God cares for them and they’re not forgotten.\"\n\"We have prepared and are airlifting 17,500 backpacks to Ukraine on our DC-8 cargo plane.\"\n\"This is why,\" he announced, \"we have prepared and are airlifting 17,500 backpacks to Ukraine on our DC-8 cargo plane.\"\nGraham, the eldest son of Billy Graham and Ruth Bell Graham, is also CEO and president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. He told Fox News Digital as well, \"These book bags give children something to put their belongings in as they flee.\"\n\"We have also put some things inside that will be a blessing to them. We included a stuffed teddy bear that says ‘God Loves You’ in Ukrainian on the front — as well as crayons, a sketch pad, a knit hat, a ball and a booklet in Ukrainian that reminds them God loves them.\"\n\"Please pray that God would protect them and bring an end to this devastating crisis.\"\nThe Christian leader added, \"We need to keep praying for the people of Ukraine. Their lives have been turned upside down and they’re hurting.\"\n\"Please pray,\" he added, \"that God would protect them and bring an end to this devastating crisis.\"\nRev.

The strike on the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital, which interrupted open-heart surgery and forced young cancer patients to take their treatments outdoors, drew an international outcry.\nRUSSIAN MISSILES HIT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN KYIV AS UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY VOWS RETALIATION\nThe 10-story hospital, which is Ukraine's largest medical facility for children, was caring for some 670 patients at the time of the attack, Okhmatdyt’s Director General, Volodymyr Zhovnir, said Tuesday. The missile hit a two-story wing of the hospital.\n\"The building where we conducted dialysis for children with kidney failure or acute intoxication is ruined entirely,\" he told reporters, estimating the overall damage to the hospital at $2.5 million.\nDanielle Bell, the head of a U.N. team tracking human rights violations in Ukraine, said at least two people were killed at the hospital and some 50 people were injured, including seven children.\nEmergency services work at the site of Okhmatdyt children’s hospital hit by Russian missiles, in Kyiv, Ukraine, on July 8, 2024.(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka)\nThe casualty figure would have been much higher if patients hadn't been taken to a bunker when air raid sirens first sounded, she added.\nAuthorities were working to restore the hospital's power and water supply, Zhovnir said.\nKyiv city administrators declared Tuesday an official day of mourning. Entertainment events were prohibited and flags were lowered in the capital.\nRussia denied responsibility for the hospital strike, insisting it doesn’t attack civiliantargets in Ukrainedespite abundant evidence to the contrary, including Associated Press reporting.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday repeated that position, pointing to a Russian Defense Ministry statement that blamed a Ukrainian air defense missile for partially destroying the hospital.\nBell, the head of the U.N. team, dismissed that argument. She said an assessment of video footage and findings on site indicated the hospital \"took a direct hit, rather than receiving damage due to an intercepted weapons system.\"\nThe hospital likely was struck by a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile, Bell said. Ukrainian officials said the same.\nThe bodies of three more people were found Tuesday under the rubble of a residential building in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv, officials said, bringing the death toll in the single building to 10.\nThe Russian onslaught Monday came on the eve of a NATO summit in Washington where alliance countries are expected to pledge newmilitary and economic support for Ukraine.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, was hosting India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Moscow.\nNew Delhi’s importance as a key trading partner has grown since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nZelenskyy was deeply critical of Modi’s visit, saying on X late Monday: \"It is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world’s largest democracy hug the world’s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.\"\nMeanwhile, Russian military and regional officials said Tuesday that Ukrainian drones targeted six Russian regions overnight, in what appeared to be a bigger-than-usual aerial attack by Kyiv's forces.\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said air defense systems in five Russian southern and western regions \"destroyed and intercepted\" a total of 38 Ukrainian drones.",

At least one cluster munition strike hit a hospital, killing four and injuring 10.\n\"There were two children, I believe, who were killed and two others and six injured because of the explosive force of the bomb,\" said Leonard Rubenstein, the director of Johns Hopkins University's Program on Human Rights, Health and Conflict.\n\"The law is very simple and clear and goes back 150 years that it's illegal to attack a hospital, a patient, medical staff,\" he told Fox News. \"In fact, they're war crimes.\"\nKHARKIV WOMAN DESCRIBES SHELTERING FROM MISSILES, OPTS TO STAY IN THE CITY TO AVOID LEAVING FAMILY BEHIND\nThe first Geneva Convention in 1864 outlawed assaults on medical personnel on the battlefield. Since then,Russiahas avoided punishment despite repeatedly violating these terms, according to Rubenstein.\nA view of damaged building after the shelling is said by Russian forces in Ukraine's second-biggest city of Kharkiv on March 3, 2022.(Photo by SERGEY BOBOK/AFP via Getty Images)\n\"Russia has a long history of attacking hospitals,\" thehuman rightslawyer told Fox News. \"They did it in Chechnya, attacked multiple hospitals in the capital during the war in there 20 years ago.\"\n\"More recently, in Syria, they targeted hospitals in Idlib, in the northwest, in Aleppo and destroyed many hospitals,\" Rubenstein added.\nThe United Nationsfoundthat \"pro-government\" forces in Syria carried out aerial and ground attacks in 2020 on civilian markets, refugee camps, and most notably hospitals. The attacks on civilian populations included the use of cluster munitions, similar to the Russian use of cluster munitions on Ukrainian civilian areas, according to the report.\nCluster munitions are explosives that contain smaller bombs. They can strike wide areas and raze entire civilian neighborhoods.\nThis image released by the Syrian Presidency shows Russian President Vladimir Putin, center, meeting with Syrian President Bashar Assad, right, in Damascus, Syria on Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2020.(Syrian Presidency via AP)\n\"The pattern of indiscriminate attacks amounts to a war crime just as a deliberate attack is,\" Rubenstein said. \"So if these are confirmed after investigation – and of course, we don't have those investigations yet – they could be war crimes.\"\nUKRAINIAN MP WARNS KYIV WILL BE 'NEXT ALEPPO,' CALLS ON WEST TO STEP UP AS HORRIFIC IMAGES EMERGE\nWhen hospitals are attacked, the people who suffer most are the patients, Rubenstein told Fox News.\n\"As long as the fighting goes on in the cities, they will not be able to get staff to come to work, patients won't be able to get there, supplies won't be able to get there,\" he said.\nSome of the most commonly forgotten war casualties are those with chronic diseases who cannot receive treatment, he said.\nChildren patients whose treatments are underway hold papers with the words \"no war\" written in them, at the hallways of the basement floor of Okhmadet Children's Hospital, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, in Kyiv, Ukraine February 28, 2022.

Security Council than any other member, according to awatchdogreport. Recently, Russia hasblockedinvestigations into war crimes committed in the Syrian civil war.\n\"Here, the criminal court has already started an investigation because it has the power to do so and these attacks on hospitals have to be included in that investigation,\" Rubenstein said.",
